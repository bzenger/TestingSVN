abstract = {There is a global commitment to reduce premature cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) 25{\%} by 2025. CVD mortality rates have declined dramatically over the past 2 decades, yet the number of life years lost to premature CVD deaths is increasing in low- and middle-income regions. Ischemic heart disease and stroke remain the leading causes of premature death in the world; however, there is wide regional variation in these patterns. Some regions, led by Central Asia, face particularly high rates of premature death from ischemic heart disease. Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia suffer disproportionately from death from stroke. The purpose of the present report is to (1) describe global trends and regional variation in premature mortality attributable to CVD, (2) review past and current approaches to the measurement of these trends, and (3) describe the limitations of existing models of epidemiological transitions for explaining the observed distribution and trends of CVD mortality. We describe extensive variation both between and within regions even while CVD remains a dominant cause of death. Policies and health interventions will need to be tailored and scaled for a broad range of local conditions to achieve global goals for the improvement of cardiovascular health.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION We hypothesize that electrocardiographic measurements from the intramyocardial space contain more sensitive markers of ischemia than those detectable on the epicardium. The goal of this study was to evaluate different electrical markers for their potential to detect the earliest phases of acute myocardial ischemia. METHODS We conducted acute ischemia studies in open chest animal, by creating finely controlled demand or supply ischemic episodes and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. RESULTS Under the conditions of mild perfusion deficit, acute ischemia induced changes in the T wave that were larger and could be detected earlier on the epicardial surface than ST-segment changes. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that in the setting of very acute ischemia, epicardial T waves have higher sensitivity to mild degrees of acute ischemia than epicardial ST potentials. These results suggest that changes in the T wave shape may augment shifts in ST segments to improve ECG based localization of ischemia.},

abstract = {A new treadmill exercise protocol, modified from the standard Bruce method, was designed to improve ST segment/heart rate slope accuracy and applicability by reducing heart rate increments between exercise stages. In 150 patients exercised according to the new protocol and in 150 patients exercised according to the Bruce protocol, similar exercise tolerance and similar overall heart rate, systolic blood pressure and double product responses to exercise were observed. The mean increment in heart rate between exercise stages of the new protocol was ten beats/minute, which was significantly lower than the 27 beats/minute/stage found with the Bruce protocol. The accuracy of computer-measured ST segment depression was validated by comparison with physician measurement in a separate subgroup of patients with angina pectoris, and serial testing demonstrated stronger interest reproducibility for the ST segment/heart rate slope than for either measured ST setment depression, peak heart rate achieved or duration of exercise. {\textcopyright} 1986, Research in Electrocardiology, Inc..

abstract = {Electrocardiographic (ECG) ST segment shifts are often used as markers for detecting myocardial ischemia. Literature suggests that the progression of ischemia, occurs from the endocardium and spreads towards the epicardium, eventually becoming transmural. Our study with animal models has found the progression of ischemia, characterized by ST elevations to be more complex and heterogeneous in its distribution. We used in situ canine preparations, wherein the animals were subjected to demand ischemia by reducing coronary flow and raising the heart rate through atrial pacing. At reduced flow, increasing the heart rate caused pockets of ST elevations to appear variously distributed in the sub-epicardial, mid-myocardial and endocardial regions. Further reduction in coronary flow with simultaneous raising of the heart rate, increased the extent and magnitude of ST elevated regions, that in certain cases became transmural.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between epicardial and body surface potentials defines the forward problem of electrocardiography. A robust formulation of the forward problem is instrumental to solving the inverse problem, in which epicardial potentials are computed from known body surface potentials. Here, the accuracy of different forward models has been evaluated experimentally.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Body surface and epicardial potentials were recorded simultaneously in anesthetized closed-chest pigs (n=5) during sinus rhythm, and epicardial and endocardial ventricular pacing (65 records in total). Body surface potentials were simulated from epicardial recordings using experiment-specific volume conductor models constructed from magnetic resonance imaging. Results for homogeneous (isotropic electric properties) and inhomogeneous (incorporating lungs, anisotropic skeletal muscle, and subcutaneous fat) forward models were compared with measured body surface potentials. Correlation coefficients were 0.85±0.08 across all animals and activation sequences with no significant difference between homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions (P=0.85). Despite this, there was considerable variance between simulated and measured body surface potential distributions. Differences between the body surface potential extrema predicted with homogeneous forward models were 55{\%} to 78{\%} greater than observed (P{\textless}0.05) and attenuation of potentials adjacent to extrema were 10{\%} to 171{\%} greater (P{\textless}0.03). The length and orientation of the vector between potential extrema were also significantly different. Inclusion of inhomogeneous electric properties in the forward model reduced, but did not eliminate these differences.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that homogeneous volume conductor models introduce substantial spatial inaccuracies in forward problem solutions. This probably affects the precision of inverse reconstructions of cardiac potentials, in which this assumption is made.},

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive reconstructions of epicardial potentials, electrograms, activation and recovery isochrones, and beat origins by simultaneously performing electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) and invasive epicardial electrography in intact animals. Background Noninvasive imaging of electrical potentials at the epicardium, known as ECGI, is increasingly applied in patients to assess normal and abnormal cardiac electrical activity. Methods Body-surface potentials and epicardial potentials were recorded in normal anesthetized dogs. Computed tomography scanning provided a torso-heart geometry that was used to reconstruct epicardial potentials from body-surface potentials. Results Electrogram reconstructions attained a moderate accuracy compared with epicardial recordings (median correlation coefficient: 0.71), but with considerable variation (interquartile range: 0.36 to 0.86). This variation could be explained by a spatial mismatch (overall resolution was {\textless}20 mm) that was most apparent in regions with electrographic transition. More accurate derivation of activation times (Pearson R: 0.82), recovery times (R: 0.73), and the origin of paced beats (median error: 10 mm; interquartile range: 7 to 17 mm) was achieved by a spatiotemporal approach that incorporates the characteristics of the respective electrogram and neighboring electrograms. Reconstruction of beats from repeated single-site pacing showed a stable localization of origin. Cardiac motion, currently ignored in ECGI, correlates negatively with reconstruction accuracy. Conclusions ECGI shows a decent median accuracy, but variability in electrogram reconstruction can be sizable. At present, therefore, clinical interpretations of ECGI should not be made on the basis of single electrograms only. Incorporating local spatiotemporal characteristics allows for accurate reconstruction of epicardial activation and recovery patterns, and beat origin localization to a 10-mm precision. Even more reliable interpretations are expected when the influences of cardiac motion are accounted for in ECGI.},

abstract = {Ventricular intramural and epicardial potential distributions were measured during normal excitation and repolarization in intact dogs. Potential distributions were chosen because they can be unambiguously measured, are useful in understanding the shapes of wave forms at many specific sites, and provide a direct measure of repolarization. Unipolar wave forms were recorded from intramural and epicardial electrodes and converted into potential distributions. Well-known shapes of wave forms recorded at the inner and outer layers of the ventricles as well as peak-to-peak voltages were shown by the potential distributions to be determined primarily by superposition effects of distant excitation waves. These effects were most prominent before epicardial breakthrough and then receded during the last half of the QRS complex. However, the potential distributions became more complex as excitation waves merged, collided, and terminated. During terminal depolarization, there were scattered positive repolarization potentials intramurally. Normal repolarization was characterized by positive potentials over the ventricular epicardium while there were changes intramurally and on the atrium. Throughout the T wave, there was a predominant transmural unidirectional gradient with the inner wall being more negative than the outer wall. This finding confirms that the sequence of repolarization is from the epicardium to the endocardium with the middle layers having an intermediate time.},

abstract = {Introduction Myocardial ischemia is a pathological condition initiated by supply and demand imbalance of the blood to the heart. Previous studies suggest that ischemia originates in the subendocardium, i.e., that nontransmural ischemia is limited to the subendocardium. By contrast, we hypothesized that acute myocardial ischemia is not limited to the subendocardium and sought to document its spatial distribution in an animal preparation. The goal of these experiments was to investigate the spatial organization of ischemia and its relationship to the resulting shifts in ST segment potentials during short episodes of acute ischemia. Methods We conducted acute ischemia studies in open-chest canines (N = 19) and swines (N = 10), which entailed creating carefully controlled ischemia using demand, supply or complete occlusion ischemia protocols and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. Elevation of the potentials at 40{\%} of the ST segment between the J-point and the peak of the T-wave (ST40{\%}) provided the metric for local ischemia. The threshold for ischemic ST segment elevations was defined as two standard deviations away from the baseline values. Results The relative frequency of occurrence of acute ischemia was higher in the subendocardium (78{\%} for canines and 94{\%} for swines) and the mid-wall (87{\%} for canines and 97{\%} for swines) in comparison with the subepicardium (30{\%} for canines and 22{\%} for swines). In addition, acute ischemia was seen arising throughout the myocardium (distributed pattern) in 87{\%} of the canine and 94{\%} of the swine episodes. Alternately, acute ischemia was seen originating only in the subendocardium (subendocardial pattern) in 13{\%} of the canine episodes and 6{\%} of the swine episodes (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the spatial distribution of acute ischemia is a complex phenomenon arising throughout the myocardial wall and is not limited to the subendocardium.},

abstract = {Objectives. This study sought to document the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography as it has evolved at a single center and to define predictors of adverse events. Background. The indications and protocol for dobutamine stress testing have evolved over 5 years of clinical use, but the influence of these changes on the safety and side effects of the test is undefined. Methods. Over 5 years, 3,011 consecutive dobutamine stress studies were performed in 2,871 patients, using an incremental protocol from 5 to 40 $\mu$g/kg body weight per min in 3-min stages, followed by atropine or an additional stage with 50 $\mu$g/kg per min, if required. Clinical data were gathered prospectively, and hemodynamic and echocardiographic findings were recorded at each stage, including recovery. Dobutamine echocardiography was defined as positive for ischemia in the presence of new or worsening wall motion abnormalities; in the absence of ischemia, failure to attain 85{\%} of age-predicted maximal heart rate was identified as a nondiagnostic result. Results. Studies were performed for risk assessment (70{\%}) and symptom evaluation (30{\%}); over the study period, there was an increment in the use of dobutamine echocardiography for preoperative evaluation. Most tests (n = 2,194 [73{\%}]) were terminated due to attainment of peak dose with achievement of target heart rate ({\textgreater}85{\%} maximal age-predicted heart rate); 455 patients (15{\%}) failed to achieve {\textgreater}85{\%} maximal predicted heart rate despite maximal doses of dobutamine and atropine. The protocol was stopped prematurely in 230 patients (7.6{\%}) because of side effects, including ventricular (n = 27 [0.9{\%}]) and supraventricular rhythm disorders (n = 22 [0.7{\%}]), severe hypertension (n = 24 [0.8{\%}]) and hypotension or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n = 112 [3.8{\%}]). Noncardiac symptoms, such as headache, nausea or anxiety, caused early test termination in 45 patients (1.6{\%}). The remaining tests were stopped because of severe chest pain (n = 106 [3.5{\%}]) or severe ischemia by echocardiography (n = 26 [0.9{\%}]). Serious complications occurred in nine patients, including sustained ventricular tachycardia in five, myocardial infarction in one and other conditions in three requiring hospital admission (sustained supraventricular tachycardia, hypotension, suspected myocardial infarction), but neither ventricular fibrillation nor death occurred. Independent predictors of serious complications could not be defined. Over 5 years, higher dose protocols and more frequent use of atropine have raised the number of diagnostic protocols from 59{\%} to 80{\%}, without increasing the incidence of major side effects. Conclusions. Despite the use of more aggressive protocols and alterations of the indications for testing to include sicker patients, major side effects are a rare complication of dobutamine echocardiography.},

Patients were separated on the basis of single-photon emission computed tomographic defect distribution into a group with anatomically contiguous ischemia (anterior or posterior/inferior defects, n = 68) and a group with anatomically opposed ischemia (anterior and posterior/inferior defects, n = 61). ST depression in the contiguous ischemia group correlated with defect size (r = 0.40, p = 0.001) and severity (r = 0.38, p = 0.002); multivariate regression demonstrated each to be independent determinants of ST-depression magnitude (r = 0.51, p {\textless}0.001). In the opposed ischemia group, ST depression did not significantly correlate with defect extent or severity. After adjusting for differences in perfusion indexes, ST depression was paradoxically greater in the contiguous than in the opposed group (2.82 ± 1.15 vs 2.44 ± 1.15 mm, p {\textless}0.001). In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the anatomic distribution of ischemia can alter the relation between ST depression and functional indexes of ischemia and may confound the accuracy of assessments of coronary artery disease based on ST-depression magnitude alone. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Background: As an early triage strategy for CAD in emergency medicine, ex-Echo could have the advantage of widespread availability and low costs. Methods: In the years 2000-2002, 503 consecutive patients (mean age 60 years) with recent ({\textless}24 hours) CP and nonischemic electrocardiogram (ECG), in whom CAD remained undiagnosed after first line 6-hour work-up including serum markers of myocardial injury and resting echocardiogram, underwent ex-Echo and ex-SPECT within 24 hours.

End points were coronary stenosis ???50{\%} and cardiovascular events at 6-month follow-up. Results: Ninety-nine patients (20{\%}) had (+)ex-Echo and 121 (24{\%}) (+)ex-SPECT; CAD was diagnosed in 81{\%} and 67{\%}, respectively; positive tests were concordant in 69{\%}.

Ex-Echo demonstrated higher accuracy than ex-SPECT (93{\%} ?? 1{\%} vs 89{\%} ?? 1{\%}), optimal specificity (95{\%} ?? 5{\%} vs 90{\%} ?? 5{\%}), and positive predictive value (81{\%} ?? 4{\%} vs 67{\%} ?? 4{\%}); moreover, in the case of (-)ex-ECG, observed effective likelihood ratio indicates a (+)synergy between ex-ECG and ex-Echo. Conclusions: Ex-Echo can be an effective diagnostic strategy in the early triage of CP patients, improving diagnosis in case of (-)ex-ECG and reducing unnecessary angiography number. Its drawback is represented by the 5{\%} of missed diagnosis. ?? 2005, Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mechanical, histological, and biochemical improvement has been described in patients after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. Explantation of the LVADs without heart transplantation has been described in selected patients who received this therapy as a bridge to transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective review of patients receiving a mechanical bridge to transplantation at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital after July 21, 1991, was performed to determine the incidence of patients in whom the device was successfully explanted. From August 1, 1996, to February 1, 1998, we prospectively attempted to identify potential explant candidates by the use of exercise testing. During this time, we recruited 39 consecutive patients after insertion of the Thermo Cardiosystems vented electric device to participate in the following study. Approximately 3 months after device implantation, a maximal exercise test with hemodynamic monitoring and respiratory gas analysis was performed with the LVAD in the automated mode. The electric device was interfaced with a pneumatic console such that the rate could be decreased to 20 cycles/min. Hemodynamic measurements were recorded as the device rate was decreased. A repeat exercise test was then performed if the patient remained hemodynamically stable. A retrospective chart review of 111 LVAD recipients at our institution identified only 5 successful explant patients. Eighteen of the 39 patients were studied. Fifteen patients exercised with maximal device support. At peak exercise, VO2 averaged 14.5+/-3.6 mL. kg-1. min-1; LVAD flow, 8.0+/-1.3 L/min; Fick cardiac output, 11.4+/-3.3 L/min; and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 13+/-4 mm Hg. Seven patients remained normotensive and could exercise at a fixed rate of 20 cycles/min. In these patients, peak VO2 declined from 17.3+/-3.9 to 13.0+/-6.1 mL. kg-1. min-1. In one of these patients, the device was explanted. CONCLUSIONS: Significant myocardial recovery after LVAD therapy in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure occurs in a small percentage of patients. Most of these patients have dilated cardiomyopathy. Exercise testing may be a useful modality to identify those patients in whom the device can be explanted.},

abstract = {It has been recently shown that recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (rAAV8) is a robust alternative serotype vector that overcomes many of the limitations of rAAV2 and transduces various tissues efficiently and globally through systemic vector administration. AAV9 is a serotype newly isolated from human tissues, but our knowledge of the biology of rAAV9 in vivo is currently limited. Here, we demonstrate by a series of comprehensive side-by-side experiments with rAAV8 and 9 vectors delivered via different routes or at various doses in mice that rAAV9 vectors share the robustness of rAAV8, i.e., (1) very high liver transduction efficiency irrespective of whether vectors are administered intravascularly or extravascularly and (2) substantial transduction in the heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas by peripheral vein injection. Importantly, rAAV9 transduced myocardium 5- to 10-fold higher than rAAV8, resulting in over 80{\%} cardiomyocyte transduction following tail vein injection of as low as 1.0??????1011 particles per mouse. Thus rAAV9, as well as rAAV8, is a robust vector for gene therapy applications and rAAV9 is superior to rAAV8 specifically for cardiac gene delivery by systemic vector administration. ?? 2006 The American Society of Gene Therapy.},

abstract = {Spatial and nonspatial aspects of TQ-ST segment mapping were studied with the solid angle theorem and randomly coded data from 15,000 electrograms of 160 anterior descending artery occlusions each of 100-s duration performed in 18 pigs. Factors analyzed included electrode location, ischemic area and shape, wall thickness, and increases in plasma potassium (K(+)). Change from control in the TQ-ST recorded at 60 s (DeltaTQ-ST) was measured at 22 ischemic (IS) and nonischemic (NIS) epicardial sites overlying right (RV) and left (LV) ventricles. In IS regions, DeltaTQ-ST decreased according to LV {\textgreater} septum {\textgreater} RV and LV base {\textgreater} LV apex. In NIS regions, LV sites had negative (Neg) DeltaTQ-ST which increased as LV IS border was approached. However, RV NIS had positive (Pos) DeltaTQ-ST which again increased as RV IS border was approached. With large artery occlusion IS area increased 123+/-18{\%}, DeltaTQ-ST at IS sites decreased (-38.1+/-3.6{\%}), and sum of DeltaTQ-ST at IS sites increased by only 67.3+/-10.3{\%}. In RV NIS Pos DeltaTQ-ST became Neg. With increased K(+), DeltaTQ-ST decreased proportionately to log K(+) (r = 0.97+/-0.01) at IS and NIS sites on the epicardium and precordium. TQ-ST at 60 s was obliterated when K(+) = 8.7+/-0.2 mM. All findings were significant (P {\textless} 0.005) and agreed with the solid angle theorem. Thus, a transmembrane potential difference and current flow at the IS boundary alone are responsible for the TQ-ST. Nonspatial factors affect the magnitude of transmembrane potential difference, while spatial factors alter the position of the boundary to the electrode site.},

In this most comprehensive book of its kind, internationally renowned authors correlate electrocardiographic recordings with anatomical patterns of myocardial ischemia to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with ischemic heart disease." "The book is structured in two sections. Part One covers electrocardiographic patterns of ischemia, injury and infarction. Each chapter discusses a different ECG abnormality in turn, clearly explaining the ischemic insults and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying each pattern to promote rapid and accurate interpretation of the ECG in the clinical setting. ECG abnormalities are correlated with myocardial anatomy and coronary angiography to produce a series of practical diagnostic algorithms that allow the clinician to identify not only the occluded artery but the precise location of the occlusion within the artery, facilitating appropriate therapeutic decisions. The authors also propose a new classification of Q-wave myocardial infarctions based on imaging correlations with advanced techniques such as contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance." "Part Two of the book covers the ECG in clinical practice. Each chapter focuses on a different clinical syndrome, describing the role of the ECG in a global approach to the diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification of patients with acute and chronic ischemic heart disease and guiding clinical decision-making."

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the marked increase in [K+]o in response to ischemia are not fully understood. Accordingly, the present study was performed to assess the contribution of ATP-regulated K+ channels by using simultaneous measurements of cellular K+ efflux, [K+]o, transmembrane action potentials, and tissue ATP, ADP, phosphocreatine, and creatine content in a unique isolated, blood-perfused papillary muscle preparation during hypoxia compared with ischemia. During 15 minutes of hypoxic perfusion (PO2, 6.1 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) with normal [K+]o of 4.1 +/- 0.1 mM, action potential duration (APD) was not altered even though tissue ATP levels decreased markedly from 33.5 +/- 1.8 to 14.7 +/- 2.0 nmol.mg protein-1 (p {\textless} 0.01). Net cellular K+ efflux, based on measured differences of [K+] between the venous effluent and the perfusate, was 13.23 +/- 0.79 mumol.g wet wt-1 during hypoxia. In contrast, after 15 minutes of zero-flow ischemia, APD at 80{\%} of repolarization (APD80) decreased by 47{\%} from 171 +/- 5 to 92 +/- 5 msec (p {\textless} 0.01), but integrated net cellular K+ efflux over 15 minutes of ischemia was 8.4-fold less (1.57 +/- 0.13 mumol.g wet wt-1) than during hypoxia. Tissue ATP levels, however, decreased by only 35.2{\%} to 21.7 +/- 2.1 nmol.mg protein-1, which was significantly less than that induced by 15 minutes of hypoxia. Perfusion with hypoxic blood containing high [K+]o of 10.3 +/- 0.3 mM resulted in APD shortening similar to that observed during ischemia. Cellular K+ loss, however, was inhibited markedly by high [K+]o perfusion (only 4.51 +/- 0.28 mumol.g wet wt-1). Pretreatment with glibenclamide (5 microM), a drug that has been reported to inhibit ATP-regulated K+ channels and accelerate glycolysis in normoxic tissue, partially inhibited cellular K+ efflux during hypoxic perfusion with normal [K+]o (7.35 +/- 0.71 versus 13.23 +/- 0.79 mumol.g wet wt-1, p {\textless} 0.01) but had no significant influence on repolarization time or tissue ATP levels. Although glibenclamide partially prevented action potential shortening induced by hypoxic perfusion in the presence of elevated [K+]o, the proportion of cellular K+ efflux reduced by glibenclamide was less (23{\%}) than that observed with glibenclamide in hypoxic perfusion with normal [K+]o (44{\%}).},

abstract = {The normal mechanical functioning of the heart depends on proper electrical functioning, reflected in the sequential activation of pacemaker cells, and the normal propagation of activity through the ventricles. Myocardial electrical activity is evident in the form of action potentials, reflecting the activation (and inactivation) of depolarizing (Na(+), Ca(2+)) and repolarizing (K(+)) current channels. There are multiple types of myocardial K(+) channels, contributing to regional differences in action potential waveforms and to the generation of normal cardiac rhythms. The conduction and propagation of activity through the myocardium depends on electrical coupling between cells, mediated by gap junction channels. In the diseased myocardium, action potential waveforms and conduction are affected markedly, owing to changes in the functional expression of repolarizing K(+) and other channels. These changes can lead to desynchronization of the heart and to arrhythmia generation. There is presently greater interest in defining the cellular, molecular, and systemic mechanisms contributing to the generation and the maintenance of cardiac arrhythmias. Although a variety of experimental (animal) model systems have been (and are being) exploited in these efforts, the mouse is being used increasingly, due to the ease with which molecular genetic strategies can be applied. The important issue is whether the mouse is an appropriate model system to explore arrhythmia mechanisms.},

abstract = {The results of a geometric model of cardiac tissue, used to compute the bidomain conductivity tensors during three phases of ischaemia, are described. Ischaemic conditions were simulated by model parameters being changed to match the morphological and electrical changes of three phases of ischaemia reported in literature. The simulated changes included collapse of the interstitial space, cell swelling and the closure of gap junctions. The model contained 64 myocytes described by 2 million tetrahedral elements, to which an external electric field was applied, and then the finite element method was used to compute the associated current density. In the first case, a reduction in the amount of interstitial space led to a reduction in extracellular longitudinal conductivity by about 20{\%}, which is in the range of reported literature values. Moderate cell swelling in the order of 10-20{\%} did not affect extracellular conductivity considerably. To match the reported drop in total tissue conductance reported in experimental studies during the third phase of ischaemia, a ten fold increase in the gap junction resistance was simulated. This ten-fold increase correlates well with the reported changes in gap junction densities in the literature.},

abstract = {This study identifies the most sensitive electrocardiographic leads for monitoring ST-segment changes caused by acute coronary ischemia. The data set consisted of 120-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) digitally recorded during balloon-inflation angioplasty in 3 groups of patients with single-vessel disease (left anterior descending [LAD], 32; right coronary artery [RCA], 36; left circumflex [LCx], 23). The ST deviation was measured in all recorded leads during baseline and ischemic states, and its difference between these 2 states ($\Delta$ST) was calculated at 352 sites and plotted as $\Delta$ST maps. The patients in each group were divided, by means of $\Delta$ST criteria, into subgroups of "responders" and "nonresponders." Mean $\Delta$STs for each group/subgroup were calculated and standardized by the corresponding standard deviation (SD); these values were plotted as mean $\Delta$ST and t maps. Sites where extrema of $\Delta$ST occurred most frequently were sought in bootstrap trials, performed in each group/subgroup. The results suggest that the optimal sites for the ischemia-sensitive leads are: V3(+) and just below V8(-) for LAD-related ischemia; the left iliac crest (+) and above V3at the third intercostal space (-) for RCA-related ischemia; and just below V8(+) and above V2at the third intercostal space (-) for LCx-related ischemia. Three “optimal” bipolar leads using these sites registered, in the responders from the LAD, RCA, and LCx groups, mean $\Delta$ST (±SD) of 232 ± 59, 245 ± 96 and 158 ± 91 $\mu$V, respectively; the corresponding t values were 15.14, 9.90, and 6.75. In the 12-lead ECG, only lead V3approached optimal $\Delta$ST and t values for the LAD responders (187 ± 61 $\mu$V; t = 11.75) and lead III for the RCA responders (191 ± 76 $\mu$V; t = 9.73), but even these values were significantly suboptimal (P = 0.0011 and P = 0.0120, respectively). We found that the "optimal" bipolar leads can be derived, to an excellent approximation, from the 12 standard leads or from 3 EASI leads (with 3 electrodes at Frank's transverse level and 1 on the manubrium), by using precalculated regression coefficients. By means of bootstrap trials, we estimated the mean sensitivity (SE) and the mean positive predictive value (PPV) with which 3 “optimal” vessel-specific leads could identify ischemia related to the LAD, RCA, and LCx arteries, in the test set, as (SE/PPV) 94.7/92.8{\%}, 78.7/80.9{\%}, and 81.5/80.9{\%}. A similar diagnostic performance can be achieved by vessel-specific leads derived from the 12-lead ECG (93.0/93.4{\%}, 76.6/82.0{\%}, and 82.7/77.1{\%}) and, interestingly, from the EASI lead system (97.8/88.4{\%}, 78.0/80.2{\%}, and 76.8/83.2{\%}). Thus, although the “optimal” bipolar leads for detecting ischemia related to each of the 3 coronary arteries were found to require sampling outside the 12-lead ECG, these leads can be derived from the full set of 12 standard leads or - for clinical monitoring applications - from the EASI lead system by using fewer electrodes at convenient locations. {\textcopyright} 2001 Churchill Livingstone.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has become a routine modality for the determination of patient cardiac morphology. The extraction of this information can be important for the development of new clinical applications as well as the planning and guidance of cardiac interventional procedures. To avoid inter- and intra-observer variability of manual delineation, it is highly desirable to develop an automatic technique for whole heart segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images. However, automating this process is complicated by the limited quality of acquired images and large shape variation of the heart between subjects. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic whole heart segmentation framework based on two new image registration algorithms: the locally affine registration method (LARM) and the free-form deformations with adaptive control point status (ACPS FFDs). LARM provides the correspondence of anatomical substructures such as the four chambers and great vessels of the heart, while the registration using ACPS FFDs refines the local details using a constrained optimization scheme. We validated our proposed segmentation framework on 37 cardiac MR volumes on the end-diastolic phase, displaying a wide diversity of morphology and pathology, and achieved a mean accuracy of 2.14 +/- 0.63 mm (rms surface distance) and a maximal error of 4.31 mm.},

abstract = {Background: Acute myocardial ischemia is a common cause of ventricular arrhythmias, yet recent ECG methods predicting susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmia have not been fully evaluated during spontaneous ischemia. We sought to evaluate the clinical utility of alternans and non-alternans components of repolarization variability from the standard 10-second 12-lead ECG signals to risk stratify patients with acute chest pain. Methods: We enrolled consecutive, non-traumatic, chest pain patients transported through Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to three tertiary care hospitals with cardiac catheterization lab capabilities in Pittsburgh, PA. ECG signals were manually annotated by an electrophysiologist, then automatically processed using a custom-written software. Both T wave alternans (TWA) and non-alternans repolarization variability (NARV) were calculated using the absolute RMS differences over the repolarization window between odd/even averaged beats and between consecutive averaged pairs, respectively. The primary study outcome was the presence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) documented by cardiac angiography. Results: After excluding patients with secondary repolarization changes (n = 123) and those with excessive noise (n = 90), our final sample included 537 patients (age 57. ±. 16. years, 56{\%} males). Patients with AMI (n = 47, 9{\%}) had higher TWA and NARV values (p {\textless}. 0.01). Mean RR correlated with TWA, and noise measures correlated with TWA and NARV, after adjusting for potential confounders. There was a high collinearity between TWA and NARV, and each was separately predictive of AMI after controlling for number of analyzed beats, noise measures, and other clinical variables. Conclusions: Despite limitations imposed by signal quality, TWA and NARV are higher in patients with AMI, even after correction for potential confounders. The clinical value of TWA and NARV derived from standard ECG using our time-domain RMS method is questionable due to the small number of beats and significant noise.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded small RNAs used by organisms to regulate the expression of proteins generated from messenger RNA transcripts. The in vivo requirement of specific miRNAs in mammals through targeted deletion remains unknown, and reliable prediction of mRNA targets is still problematic. Here, we show that miRNA biogenesis in the mouse heart is essential for cardiogenesis. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1-2, revealed numerous functions in the heart, including regulation of cardiac morphogenesis, electrical conduction, and cell-cycle control. Analyses of miR-1 complementary sequences in mRNAs upregulated upon miR-1-2 deletion revealed an enrichment of miR-1 "seed matches" and a strong tendency for potential miR-1 binding sites to be located in physically accessible regions. These findings indicate that subtle alteration of miRNA dosage can have profound consequences in mammals and demonstrate the utility of mammalian loss-of-function models in revealing physiologic miRNA targets. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Aim: Determination of the phenotype of adult human atrial and ventricular myocytes based on gene expression and morphology. Methods: Atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes were obtained from patients undergoing cardiac surgery using a modified isolation procedure. Myocytes were isolated and cultured with or without serum. The relative cell attachment promoting efficiency of several reagents was evaluated and compared. Morphological changes during long-term culture were assessed with phase contrast microscopy, morphometric analysis and immunocytochemistry or RT-PCR of sarcomeric markers including ??-actinin, myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) and the adhesion molecule, cadherin. Results: The isolation method produced viable rod-shaped atrial (16.6??6.0{\%}, mean??S.E.; n=5) and ventricular cells (22.4??8.0{\%}, mean??S.E.; n=5) in addition to significant numbers of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Cell dedifferentiation was characterized by the loss of sarcomeric structure, condensation and extrusion of sarcomeric proteins. Cells cultured with low serum recovered and assumed a flattened, spread form with two distinct morphologies apparent. Type I cells were large, had extensive sarcolemmal spreading, with stress fibers and nascent myofibrils, whilst type II cells appeared smaller, with more mature myofibril organisation and focal adhesions. Conclusion: Characterization of the redifferentiation capabilities of cultured adult cardiac myocytes in culture, provides an important system for comparing cardiomyocytes differentiating from human stem cells and provides the basis for an in vitro transplantation model to study interaction and communication between primary adult and stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. ?? 2003 European Society of Cardiology.

All patients were being evaluated for known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). DSE was interpreted blindly as normal or showing evidence of CAD, depending on the presence of resting or inducible wall motion abnormalities. Coronary arteriograms were reviewed in a blinded, quantitative fashion. DSE had a sensitivity of 96{\%} for detecting patients with CAD, and a specificity of 66{\%}. For the 53 patients with normal resting wall motion, sensitivity was 87{\%} and specificity 91{\%}. The protocol was well-tolerated by all patients. In comparison with wall motion analysis, 12-lead electrocardiograms during dobutamine infusion revealed ischemic changes in only 17{\%} of patients with CAD. It is concluded that DSE is a clinically useful and accurate means for detecting CAD, its specificity is hindered in patients with resting wall motion abnormalities, and it can safely be used in patients with known cardiac disease.},

abstract = {Background: Knowledge of the shock potential gradient (???V) and postshock activation is limited to internal defibrillation of short-duration ventricular fibrillation (SDVF). Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine these variables after external defibrillation of long-duration VF (LDVF). Methods: In six pigs, 115-20 plunge needles with three to six electrodes each were inserted to record throughout both ventricles. After the chest was closed, the biphasic defibrillation threshold (DFT) was determined after 20 seconds of SDVF with external defibrillation pads. After 7 minutes of LDVF, defibrillation shocks that were less than or equal to the SDVF DFT strength were given. Results: For DFT shocks (1632 ?? 429 V), the maximum minus minimum ventricular voltage (160 ?? 100 V) was 9.8{\%} of the shock voltage. Maximum cardiac ???V (28.7 ?? 17 V/cm) was 4.7 ?? 2.0 times the minimum ???V (6.2 ?? 3.5 V/cm). Although LDVF did not increase the DFT in five of the six pigs, it significantly lengthened the time to earliest postshock activation following defibrillation (1.6 ?? 2.2 seconds for SDVF and 4.9 ?? 4.3 seconds for LDVF). After LDVF, 1.3 ?? 0.8 episodes of spontaneous refibrillation occurred per animal, but there was no refibrillation after SDVF. Conclusion: Compared with previous studies of internal defibrillation, during external defibrillation much less of the shock voltage appears across the heart and the shock field is much more even; however, the minimum ???V is similar. Compared with external defibrillation of SDVF, the biphasic external DFT for LDVF is not increased; however, time to earliest postshock activation triples. Refibrillation is common after LDVF but not after SDVF in these normal hearts, indicating that LDVF by itself can cause refibrillation without requiring preexisting heart disease. ?? 2008 Heart Rhythm Society.},

A special form of conduction that underlies many cardiac arrhythmias involves circulating excitation. In this situation, the curvature of the propagating excitation wavefront and the interaction of the wavefront with the repolarization tail of the preceding wave are additional important determinants of impulse propagation.

abstract = {Objectives: We tested whether an assessment of myocardial scarring by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would improve risk stratification in patients evaluated for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Background: Current sudden cardiac death risk stratification emphasizes left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); however, most patients suffering sudden cardiac death have a preserved LVEF, and many with poor LVEF do not benefit from ICD prophylaxis. Methods: One hundred thirty-seven patients undergoing evaluation for possible ICD placement were prospectively enrolled and underwent cardiac MRI assessment of LVEF and scar. The pre-specified primary endpoint was death or appropriate ICD discharge for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Results: During a median follow-up of 24 months the primary endpoint occurred in 39 patients. Whereas the rate of adverse events steadily increased with decreasing LVEF, a sharp step-up was observed for scar size {\textgreater}5{\%} of left ventricular mass (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.2; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 2.0 to 13.3). On multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, including LVEF and electrophysiological-study results, scar size (as a continuous variable or dichotomized at 5{\%}) was an independent predictor of adverse outcome. Among patients with LVEF {\textgreater}30{\%}, those with significant scarring ({\textgreater}5{\%}) had higher risk than those with minimal or no (≤5{\%}) scarring (HR: 6.3; 95{\%} CI: 1.4 to 28.0). Those with LVEF {\textgreater}30{\%} and significant scarring had risk similar to patients with LVEF ≤30{\%} (p = 0.56). Among patients with LVEF ≤30{\%}, those with significant scarring again had higher risk than those with minimal or no scarring (HR: 3.9; 95{\%} CI: 1.2 to 13.1). Those with LVEF ≤30{\%} and minimal scarring had risk similar to patients with LVEF {\textgreater}30{\%} (p = 0.71). Conclusions: Myocardial scarring detected by cardiac MRI is an independent predictor of adverse outcome in patients being considered for ICD placement.

abstract = {Optogenetics is an emerging technology for optical interrogation and control of biological function with high specificity and high spatiotemporal resolution. Mammalian cells and tissues can be sensitized to respond to light by a relatively simple and well-tolerated genetic modification using microbial opsins (light-gated ion channels and pumps). These can achieve fast and specific excitatory or inhibitory response, offering distinct advantages over traditional pharmacological or electrical means of perturbation. Since the first demonstrations of utility in mammalian cells (neurons) in 2005, optogenetics has spurred immense research activity and has inspired numerous applications for dissection of neural circuitry and understanding of brain function in health and disease, applications ranging from in vitro to work in behaving animals. Only recently (since 2010), the field has extended to cardiac applications with less than a dozen publications to date. In consideration of the early phase of work on cardiac optogenetics and the impact of the technique in understanding another excitable tissue, the brain, this review is largely a perspective of possibilities in the heart. It covers the basic principles of operation of light-sensitive ion channels and pumps, the available tools and ongoing efforts in optimizing them, overview of neuroscience use, as well as cardiac-specific questions of implementation and ideas for best use of this emerging technology in the heart.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence indicates that the function of members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family extends beyond blood vessel formation. Here, we show that the prolonged intramyocardial expression of VEGF-A(165) and VEGF-B(167) on adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery determined a marked improvement in cardiac function after myocardial infarction in rats, by promoting cardiac contractility, preserving viable cardiac tissue, and preventing remodeling of the left ventricle (LV) over time. Consistent with this functional outcome, animals treated with both factors showed diminished fibrosis and increased contractile myocardium, which were more pronounced after expression of the selective VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) ligand VEGF-B, in the absence of significant induction of angiogenesis. We found that cardiomyocytes expressed VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and neuropilin-1 and that, in particular, VEGFR-1 was specifically up-regulated in hypoxia and on exposure to oxidative stress. VEGF-B exerted powerful antiapoptotic effect in both cultured cardiomyocytes and after myocardial infarction in vivo. Finally, VEGFR-1 activation by VEGF-B was found to elicit a peculiar gene expression profile proper of the compensatory, hypertrophic response, consisting in activation of alphaMHC and repression of betaMHC and skeletal alpha-actin, and an increase in SERCA2a, RYR, PGC1alpha, and cardiac natriuretic peptide transcripts, both in cultured cardiomyocytes and in infarcted hearts. The finding that VEGFR-1 activation by VEGF-B prevents loss of cardiac mass and promotes maintenance of cardiac contractility over time has obvious therapeutic implications.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate different electrical markers for their potential to detect the earliest phases of acute myocardial ischemia. Methods We conducted acute ischemia studies in open chest animal, by creating finely controlled demand or supply ischemic episodes and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. Results Under the conditions of mild perfusion deficit, acute ischemia induced changes in the T wave that were larger and could be detected earlier on the epicardial surface than ST-segment changes. Conclusions Our findings indicate that in the setting of very acute ischemia, epicardial T waves have higher sensitivity to mild degrees of acute ischemia than epicardial ST potentials. These results suggest that changes in the T wave shape may augment shifts in ST segments to improve ECG based localization of ischemia.},

abstract = {The effects of ischemic preconditioning on epicardial T-Q and S-T segment mapping, local activation, and coronary blood flow were analyzed in nine barbiturate-anesthetized pigs during four coronary occlusion (5 min)-reperfusion (20 min) sequences. In seven sham pigs, one occlusion was performed after a control period of 75 min. The first reperfusion induced a marked coronary hyperemia [11 +/- 4 ml/min (baseline) to 33 +/- 16 ml/min, P {\textless} 0.005] and a rapid recovery (30 to 150 s) of epicardial activation delays, T-Q segment depression, and S-T segment elevation in the ischemia area. This recovery was transiently associated with enlargement of intersite T-Q potential variability (alpha: 2.5 +/- 0.6 to 3.4 +/- 0.7 mV, P {\textless} 0.05), T-Q segment overshoot to +1.4 +/- 0.9 mV, and S-T segment reelevation. A brief T-Q segment depression (-2.3 +/- 0.9 mV) occurred during early reperfusion in 60 of 91 electrodes overlying the normal myocardium. Compared with the first, the fourth occlusion induced lower S-T segment elevation (3.4 +/- 2.0 to 1.7 +/- 1.9 mV, P {\textless} 0.05), and the fourth reperfusion elicited a faster reversal of T-Q segment dispersion (53 +/- 21 to 43 +/- 16 s, P {\textless} 0.05), S-T segment elevation (149 +/- 101 to 81 +/- 45 s, P {\textless} 0.05), and coronary hyperemia (8 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 1 min, P {\textless} 0.05). This trend of changes was not observed during a fourth occlusion in sham pigs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Rationale: Mammalian cardiomyocytes withdraw from the cell cycle during early postnatal development, which significantly limits the capacity of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate after injury. The regulatory mechanisms that govern cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal and binucleation are poorly understood. Objective: Given the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) to influence large gene networks and modify complex developmental and disease phenotypes, we searched for miRNAs that were regulated during the postnatal switch to terminal differentiation. Methods and Results: Microarray analysis revealed subsets of miRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated in cardiac ventricles from mice at 1 and 10 days of age (P1 and P10). Interestingly, miR-195 (a member of the miR-15 family) was the most highly upregulated miRNA during this period, with expression levels almost 6-fold higher in P10 ventricles relative to P1. Precocious overexpression of miR-195 in the embryonic heart was associated with ventricular hypoplasia and ventricular septal defects in $\beta$-myosin heavy chain-miR-195 transgenic mice. Using global gene profiling and argonaute-2 immunoprecipitation approaches, we showed that miR-195 regulates the expression of a number of cell cycle genes, including checkpoint kinase 1 (Chek1), which we identified as a highly conserved direct target of miR-195. Finally, we demonstrated that knockdown of the miR-15 family in neonatal mice with locked nucleic acid-modified anti-miRNAs was associated with an increased number of mitotic cardiomyocytes and derepression of Chek1. Conclusions: These findings suggest that upregulation of the miR-15 family during the neonatal period may be an important regulatory mechanism governing cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal and binucleation.},

abstract = {Automatic image processing methods are a prerequisite to efficiently analyze the large amount of image data produced by computed tomography (CT) scanners during cardiac exams. This paper introduces a model-based approach for the fully automatic segmentation of the whole heart (four chambers, myocardium, and great vessels) from 3-D CT images. Model adaptation is done by progressively increasing the degrees-of-freedom of the allowed deformations. This improves convergence as well as segmentation accuracy. The heart is first localized in the image using a 3-D implementation of the generalized Hough transform. Pose misalignment is corrected by matching the model to the image making use of a global similarity transformation. The complex initialization of the multicompartment mesh is then addressed by assigning an affine transformation to each anatomical region of the model. Finally, a deformable adaptation is performed to accurately match the boundaries of the patient's anatomy. A mean surface-to-surface error of 0.82 mm was measured in a leave-one-out quantitative validation carried out on 28 images. Moreover, the piecewise affine transformation introduced for mesh initialization and adaptation shows better interphase and interpatient shape variability characterization than commonly used principal component analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Reciprocal ST-segment depression simulating additional subendocardial ischemia is commonly observed in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE To study the mechanism and characterization of the whole reciprocal electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns induced by acute coronary artery occlusion at different locations in the absence of additional subendocardial ischemia in pigs. METHODS Conventional 12-lead ECG and/or local extracellular epicardial, mid-myocardial, and endocardial electrograms were recorded during the acute occlusion of right coronary (RC) and left anterior descending (LAD) coronary arteries in the in situ (n = 9) or in the isolated perfused (n = 5) pig hearts. RESULTS Mid-RC occlusion induced reciprocal ST-segment depression (-0.43 ± 0.14 mV; P {\textless} .01) and S-wave deepening (-0.74 ± 0.23 mV; P {\textless} .01) in anterior ECG leads. Mid-LAD occlusion induced reciprocal S-wave deepening (-0.43 ± 0.37 mV; P = .02) but not ST-segment depression in inferior leads. Proximal LAD induced reciprocal ST-segment depression (-0.21 ± 0.20 mV; P = .03) and S-wave deepening (-0.56 ± 0.58 mV; P = .04) in inferior leads. Reciprocal QRS widening was observed only during proximal LAD occlusion. Local extracellular recordings did not show significant reciprocal QRS and ST-segment changes. CONCLUSIONS In the absence of additional subendocardial ischemia, acute coronary artery occlusion induces reciprocal ST-segment and S-wave changes in the 12-lead ECG that allow better differentiation between proximal and mid-LAD occlusion. Reciprocal ECG changes depend on conventional lead system design and not on the transmission of injury currents from the ischemic border zone to distant normal myocardium. {\textcopyright} 2013 Heart Rhythm Society.

abstract = {Background. To overcome the relatively low accuracy of exercise stress testing (EST) in detecting coronary artery disease (CAD), both echocardiography and perfusion scintigraphy have been evaluated in conjunction with pharmacologic stress, but there is still uncertainty of the relative value of these tests as possible first-line examinations for suspected CAD. This study evaluated the accuracy of EST, dipyridamole and dobutamine stress echocardiography (DIP-ECHO, DOB-ECHO), and dipyridamole and dobutamine technetium 99m sestamibi tomography (DIP-MIBI, DOB-MIBI) for the detection of CAD in patients evaluated for the first time because of chest pain. Methods and results. Sixty patients underwent EST, DIP-ECHO, DOB-ECHO, DIP-MIBI, and DOB-MIBI. Echocardiographic images were acquired simultaneously with sestamibi injections, and the scintigraphic images were collected 1 hour later. Coronary angiography was performed within 15 days. Out of 33 patients with significant ( {\textgreater} 70{\%}) coronary stenoses, 19 (58{\%}) were correctly identified by EST, 18 (55{\%}) by DIP-ECHO, 20 (61{\%}) by DOB-ECHO, 32 (97{\%}) by DIP-MIBI, and 30 (91{\%}) by DOB-MIBI (p {\textless} 0.005 for MIBI vs EST and ECHO). The specificity of EST was 67{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05 vs ECHO and MIBI), 96{\%}, 96{\%}, 89{\%}, and 81{\%}, respectively. Of the 62 stenotic coronary arteries, 20 (32{\%}) were correctly identified by DIP-ECHO, 24 (39{\%}) by DOB-ECHO, 48 (77{\%}) by DIP-MIBI, and 45 (73{\%}) by DOB-MIBI. The sensitivity of the imaging techniques in predicting the presence of multivessel disease was 14{\%} and 29{\%} for DIP and DOB-ECHO compared with 48{\%} and 57{\%} for DIP and DOB-MIBI. Conclusions. Our results confirm the limited reliability of EST in detecting CAD and the good diagnostic value of DIP and DOB-MIBI. Conversely, the lower sensitivity and the poorer capability to recognize multivessel CAD do not support the role of either DIP or DOB-ECHO as first-line examination for suspected CAD.},

In this paper, we propose an novel, semi-automatic approach to segment the left ventricular wall and classify scar tissue using a combination of modern image processing techniques. We obtained high-resolution magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA) and late-gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) in 14 patients who had ventricular scar from a prior myocardial infarction. We applied (1) a level set-based segmentation approach using a combination of the MRA and LGE-MRI to segment the myocardium and then (2) an automated signal intensity algorithm (Otsu thresholding) to identify ventricular scar tissue. We compared results from both steps to those of expert observers. The LV geometry using the semi-automated segmentation method had a mean overlap of 94{\%} with the manual segmentations. The scar volumes obtained with the Otsu method correlated with the expert observer scar volumes (Dice comparison coefficient of 0.85± 0.11). This proof of concept segmentation pipeline provides a more objective method for identifying scar in the left ventricle than manual approaches.},

abstract = {An automated method to estimate vector fields of propagation velocity from observed epicardial extracellular potentials is introduced. The method relies on fitting polynomial surfaces T(x, y) to the space-time (x, y, t) coordinates of activity. Both speed and direction of propagation are computed from the gradient of the local polynomial surface. The components of velocity, which are total derivatives, are expressed in terms of the partial derivatives which comprise the gradient of T. The method was validated on two-dimensional (2-D) simulations of propagation and then applied to cardiac mapping data. Conduction velocity was estimated at multiple epicardial locations during sinus rhythm, pacing, and ventricular fibrillation (VF) in pigs. Data were obtained via a 528-channel mapping system from 23 x 22 and 24 x 21 arrays of unipolar electrodes sutured to the right ventricular epicardium. Velocity estimates are displayed as vector fields and are used to characterize propagation qualitatively and quantitatively during both simple and complex rhythms.},

abstract = {A mathematical description of cardiac anatomy is presented for use with finite element models of the electrical activation and mechanical function of the heart. The geometry of the heart is given in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates defined at the nodes of a finite element mesh and interpolated within elements by a combination of linear Lagrange and cubic Hermite basis functions. Cardiac microstructure is assumed to have three axes of symmetry: one aligned with the muscle fiber orientation (the fiber axis); a second set orthogonal to the fiber direction and lying in the newly identified myocardial sheet plane (the sheet axis); and a third set orthogonal to the first two, in the sheet-normal direction. The geometry, fiber-axis direction, and sheet-axis direction of a dog heart are fitted with parameters defined at the nodes of the finite element mesh. The fiber and sheet orientation parameters are defined with respect to the ventricular geometry such that 1) they can be applied to any heart of known dimensions, and 2) they can be used for the same heart at various states of deformation, as is needed, for example, in continuum models of ventricular contraction.},

abstract = {As the adult mammalian heart has limited potential for regeneration and repair, the loss of cardiomyocytes during injury and disease can result in heart failure and death. The cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in heart growth and development can be exploited to repair the injured adult heart through 'reawakening' pathways that are active during embryogenesis. Heart function has been restored in rodents by reprogramming non-myocytes into cardiomyocytes, by expressing transcription factors (GATA4, HAND2, myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and T-box 5 (TBX5)) and microRNAs (miR-1, miR-133, miR-208 and miR-499) that control cardiomyocyte identity. Stimulating cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation by activating mitotic signalling pathways involved in embryonic heart growth represents a complementary approach for heart regeneration and repair. Recent advances in understanding the mechanistic basis of heart development offer exciting opportunities for effective therapies for heart failure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dobutamine-stress and dipyridamole-stress echocardiographies are widely used for pharmacological stress echocardiography, with wide geographical variations. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether evidence derived from the literature indicates or disapproves that either stress modality confers diagnostic superiority. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed literature of published trials with head-to-head comparison, on the same population, of high-dose (0.84 mg/kg) dipyridamole-stress versus high-dose (up to 40 micrograms/kg per min) dobutamine-stress echocardiography. Data from 12 studies performed in 12 institutions in seven countries were analysed. Angiographic information about 818 patients was considered. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracies of the two tests were similar (631 of 818, 77{\%}, for dipyridamole versus 654 of 818, 80{\%}, for dobutamine, NS). Overall sensitivities were 403 of 568 (71{\%}) for dipyridamole and 437 of 568 (77{\%}) for dobutamine (P {\textless} 0.05). Sensitivities for patients with single-vessel disease were 177 of 275 (64{\%}) for dipyridamole and 203 of 275 (74{\%}) for dobutamine (P {\textless} 0.05). Sensitivities for patients with multivessel disease were 162 of 203 (80{\%}) for dipyridamole and 163 of 203 (80{\%}) for dobutamine (NS). Specificities were 232 of 250 (93{\%}) for dipyridamole and 217 of 250 (87{\%}) for dobutamine (P {\textless} 0.05). Data from an additional 26 studies with dipyridamole alone and 47 studies with dobutamine alone were analysed. The diagnostic accuracies were 80{\%} for dipyridamole (n = 2038 patients; 95{\%} confidence interval 75-82{\%}) and 82{\%} for dobutamine (n = 4264 patients; 95{\%} confidence interval 79-84{\%}). CONCLUSION: High-dose dobutamine-stress and high-dose dipyridamole-stress echocardiographies have comparable diagnostic accuracies, with a slightly higher sensitivity with dobutamine and a slightly higher specificity with dipyridamole.},

abstract = {Electrical properties of myocardial tissue are anisotropic due to the complex structure of the myocardial fiber orientation and the distribution of gap junctions. For this reason, measured myocardial impedance may differ depending on the current distribution and direction with respect to myocardial fiber orientation and, consequently, according to the measurement method. The objective of this study is to compare the specific impedance spectra of the myocardium measured using two different methods. One method consisted of transmural measurements using an intracavitary catheter and the other method consisted of nontransmural measurements using a four-needle probe inserted into the epicardium. Using both methods, we provide the in situ specific impedance spectrum (magnitude and phase angle) of normal, ischemic, and infarcted pig myocardium tissue from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Magnitude spectra showed no significant differences between the measurement techniques. However, the phase angle spectra showed significant differences for normal and ischemic tissues according to the measurement technique. The main difference is encountered after 60 min of acute ischemia in the phase angle spectrum. Healed myocardial tissue showed a small and flat phase angle spectrum in both methods due to the low content of cells in the transmural infarct scar. In conclusion, both transmural and nontransmural measurements of phase angle spectrum allow the differentiation among normal, ischemic, and infarcted tissue.},

A goal of CAP is to facilitate collaborative statistical analysis of regional heart shape and wall motion and characterize cardiac function among and within population groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Three main open-source software components were developed: (i) a database with web-interface; (ii) a modeling client for 3D + time visualization and parametric description of shape and motion; and (iii) open data formats for semantic characterization of models and annotations. The database was implemented using a three-tier architecture utilizing MySQL, JBoss and Dcm4chee, in compliance with the DICOM standard to provide compatibility with existing clinical networks and devices. Parts of Dcm4chee were extended to access image specific attributes as search parameters. To date, approximately 3000 de-identified cardiac imaging examinations are available in the database.

Methods We reviewed data from 31 patients (30 men, 1 woman) supported more than 30 days (mean, 137 days; range, 31 to 505 days) with the HeartMate left ventricular assist system. The patients' mean age was 46 years (range, 22 to 64 years); 17 had idiopathic and 14 had ischemic cardiomyopathy. Data (anatomic, physiologic, hemodynamic, histologic, and biochemical) were collected at the time of HeartMate implantation, during support with the device temporarily off, and at the time of device explantation. Results Routine chest roentgenogram showed improvement in cardiothoracic ratio (0.62 ± 0.04 to 0.55 ± 0.03; p {\textless} 0.0001).

Depression is caused by current flowing in a transmural loop that begins and ends at the lateral boundary between healthy and ischemic tissue and passes through the transmural boundary between healthy and ischemic tissue. The result is ST depression at the epicardium over the lateral boundary. The size and direction of current flow are dictated by differences in the magnitude and orientation of anisotropic conductivity between those boundaries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS:Computer simulations verified and quantified the relationship between ST depression and conductivity differences. We used computer simulations based on an anatomically accurate, anisotropic model of canine ventricles and a bidomain representation of the effects of ischemia to verify the biophysical basis of this mechanism.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION:ST depression at the epicardium appears over a lateral boundary between healthy and ischemic tissue.},

abstract = {Background: In traditional literature, it appears that “anteroseptal” MIs with Q waves in V1-V3 involve basal anteroseptal segments although studies have questioned this belief. Methods: We studied patients with first acute anterior Q-wave ({\textgreater} 30 ms) MI. All underwent late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Those with Q waves in V1-V2 (n = 7) evidenced LGE {\textgreater} 50{\%} in 0{\%}, 43{\%}, 43{\%}, 57{\%}, and 29{\%} of the basal anteroseptal, mid anteroseptal, apical anterior, apical septal segments, and apex, respectively. Patients with Q waves in V1-V3 (n = 14), evidenced involvement was 14{\%}, 43{\%}, 43{\%}, 50{\%}, and 7{\%} of the same respective segments. In those with extensive anterior Q waves (n = 7), involvement was 0{\%}, 71{\%}, 57{\%}, 86{\%}, and 86{\%}. Conclusions: Q-wave MI in V1-V2/V3 primarily involves mid- and apical anterior and anteroseptal segments rather than basal segments. Data do not support existence of isolated basal anteroseptal or septal infarction. “Anteroapical infarction” is a more appropriate term than “anteroseptal infarction.”},

abstract = {Extrasystoles lead to several consequences, ranging from uneventful palpitations to lethal ventricular arrhythmias, in the presence of pathologies, such as myocardial ischemia. The role of working versus conducting cardiomyocytes, as well as the tissue requirements (minimal cell number) for the generation of extrasystoles, and the properties leading ectopies to become arrhythmia triggers (topology), in the normal and diseased heart, have not been determined directly in vivo. Here, we used optogenetics in transgenic mice expressing ChannelRhodopsin-2 selectively in either cardiomyocytes or the conduction system to achieve cell type-specific, noninvasive control of heart activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. By combining measurement of optogenetic tissue activation in vivo and epicardial voltage mapping in Langendorff-perfused hearts, we demonstrated that focal ectopies require, in the normal mouse heart, the simultaneous depolarization of at least 1,300-1,800 working cardiomyocytes or 90-160 Purkinje fibers. The optogenetic assay identified specific areas in the heart that were highly susceptible to forming extrasystolic foci, and such properties were correlated to the local organization of the Purkinje fiber network, which was imaged in three dimensions using optical projection tomography. Interestingly, during the acute phase of myocardial ischemia, focal ectopies arising from this location, and including both Purkinje fibers and the surrounding working cardiomyocytes, have the highest propensity to trigger sustained arrhythmias. In conclusion, we used cell-specific optogenetics to determine with high spatial resolution and cell type specificity the requirements for the generation of extrasystoles and the factors causing ectopies to be arrhythmia triggers during myocardial ischemia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mediastinal nerve stimulation (MNS) reproducibly evokes atrial fibrillation (AF) by excessive and heterogeneous activation of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons. This study evaluated whether pre-emptive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) impacts MNS-induced evoked changes in IC neural network activity to thereby alter susceptibility to AF. METHODS: IC neuronal activity in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was directly recorded in anesthetized canines (n=8) using a linear microelectrode array concomitant with right atrial electrical activity in response to: 1) epicardial touch or great vessel occlusion vs (2) stellate or vagal stimulation. From these stressors, post-hoc analysis (based on the Skellam distribution) defined IC neurons so recorded as afferent, efferent or convergent (afferent and efferent inputs) local circuit neurons (LCN). The capacity of right-sided MNS to modify IC activity in the induction of AF was determined prior to and after pre-emptive right (RCV) vs left-sided (LCV) VNS (15 Hz, 500microsec; 1.2x bradycardia threshold). RESULTS: Neuronal (n=89) activity at baseline (0.11+/-0.29Hz) increased during MNS-induced AF (0.51+/-1.30Hz; p{\textless}0.001). Convergent LCN's were preferentially activated by MNS. Pre-emptive RCV reduced MNS-induced changes in LCN activity (by 70{\%}), while mitigating MNS-induced AF (by 75{\%}). Pre-emptive LCV reduced LCN activity by 60{\%}, while mitigating AF potential by 40{\%}. IC neuronal synchrony increased during neurally-induced AF, a local neural network response mitigated by pre-emptive VNS. These anti-arrhythmic effects persisted post-VNS for, on average, 26 min. CONCLUSIONS: VNS preferentially targets convergent LCNs and their interactive coherence to mitigate the potential for neurally-induced AF. The anti-arrhythmic properties imposed by VNS exhibit memory.},

abstract = {The relation between T-wave changes and regional contraction during dobutamine stress echocardiography at low (5 to 10 microg/kg/min) and high (20 to 40 microg/kg/min) doses in 43 consecutive patients, early (7+/-2 days) after first recent Q-wave acute myocardial infarction has been evaluated. T-wave changes detected in {\textgreater} or =2 infarct-related electrocardiographic leads during dobutamine infusion were defined as follow: (1) negative T waves becoming positive, (2) positive T waves becoming upright {\textgreater} or =2 mm, and (3) negative T waves becoming upright {\textgreater} or =2 mm from baseline. Wall motion score index (WMSI) was defined as the sum of the echocardiographic scores of 16 segments divided by total segments considered at baseline, and at low and peak doses of dobutamine. Patients were classified according to the absence or presence of dobutamine T-wave changes. Those without T-wave changes had a significantly higher WMSI at rest (1.68+/-0.23 vs 1.50+/-0.21; p {\textless}0.05) and at peak (1.77+/-0.34 vs 1.51+/-.30 p {\textless}0.05) of dobutamine stress testing, without higher incidence of viability, homozonal, and heterozonal ischemia and chest pain. The angiographic patterns were similar between groups. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between WMSI and T-wave amplitude at baseline (R = 0.38, p = 0.01) and at peak dobutamine stress testing (R = 0.50, p = 0.0006). The sensitivity sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of T-wave changes to detect myocardial viability were 0.27, 0.84, and 0.70, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of T-wave changes to detect homozonal ischemia were 0.76, 0.27, and 0.46, respectively. In conclusion, dobutamine-induced T-wave changes are associated with a greater extent of wall motion abnormalities both at rest and at peak stress echocardiography, but they are of little value in predicting myocardial viability when analyzed early after myocardial infarction.},

We investigated the physiologic rationale underlying the optimal choice of pharmacologic stress for functional versus perfusion imaging. With the use of an open-chest dog model, a critical stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery was produced with total ablation of hyperemic response to a 15 sec period of complete occlusion. Regional left ventricular wall thickening was assessed by quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined by microspheres in both the flow-restricted left circumflex area and the control area supplied by the left anterior descending artery. Eight dogs received 15 micrograms/kg/min dobutamine intravenously for 10 min, and nine dogs received 0.14 mg/kg/min dipyridamole intravenously for 4 min. Dobutamine induced wall thickening abnormalities in all dogs while dipyridamole induced dysfunction in only 55{\%} of the animals studied (p less than .01). Subendocardial blood flow to the left circumflex area was unchanged after both dobutamine and dipyridamole when compared with baseline blood flow. However, subendocardial blood flow increased markedly after dipyridamole in the control area. Regional subendocardial blood flow ratio (left anterior descending/left circumflex) was 3.74 +/- 0.09 (mean +/- SEM) after dipyridamole versus 1.27 +/- 0.09 after dobutamine (p less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Heart failure (HF) has become the dominant cardiovascular disorder in the Western world and Japan, so there is an urgent need to clarify the mechanisms governing pathological remodeling mediated through cell death, and to identify ways of preventing and treating HF. Historically, there are 3 types of cell death: apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis. Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, has been well characterized and the molecular events involved in apoptotic death are well understood. Necrosis is often defined in a negative manner: death lacking the characteristics of programmed cell death and thus accidental and uncontrolled. However, recent studies indicate that necrosis is tightly regulated. Autophagy is a cell survival mechanism that involves degradation and recycling of cytoplasmic components. In contrast to the other 2 mechanisms, autophagy may mediate cell death under specific circumstances. In fact, damaged cardiomyocytes that show characteristics of autophagy have been observed during HF. However, a recent study indicated that upregulation of autophagy in the failing heart is an adaptive response. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the molecular mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell death in HF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many years was considered that negative T wave in ischemic heart disease represents ischemia and for many authors located in subepicardial area. METHODS: We performed a review based in the literature and in the experience of the authors commenting the real significance of the presence of negative T wave in patients with ischemic heart disease. RESULTS: The negative T wave may be of primary or secondary type. Negative T wave observed in ischemic heart disease are of primary origin, therefore not a consequence of abnormal repolarization pattern. The negative T wave of ischemic origin presents the following characteristics: (1) are symmetrical and of variable deepness; (2) present mirror patterns; (3) starts in the second part of repolarization; and (4) may be accompanied by positive or negative U wave. The negative T wave of ischemic origin may be seen in the following clinical settings: (1) postmyocardial infarction due to a window effect of necrotic zone and (2) as a consequence of reperfusion in case of aborted MI when the artery has opened spontaneously, or after fibrinolysis, PCI, or coronary spasm. CONCLUSION: Acute ongoing ischemia do not cause negative T wave. This pattern appears when the ongoing ischemia is vanishing or in the chronic phase. In all these cases the cause of negative T wave is not located in the subepicardial area. Furthermore, positive exercise testing is expressed by ST depression never by isolated negative T wave. There are many circumstances that may present negative T wave outside ischemic heart disease and that have been discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial ischemia in opposite regions may attenuate ST-segment changes, but whether this effect is expressed differently in extracardiac compared to direct intramyocardial recordings is not well known.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize ST-segment changes induced by opposite ischemic regions in intact and isolated perfused pig hearts.
METHODS: Left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary arteries (RCA) were occluded in 7 closed chest pigs and in 5 isolated pig hearts. ST-segment changes were analyzed in 12-lead ECG and in local extracellular electrograms.
RESULTS: Isolated LAD or RCA occlusion induced maximal ST-segment elevation in leads V4 (0.84 ± 0.30 mV, P = .003) and III (0.16 ± 0.11 mV, P = .04), respectively. RCA occlusion also induced reciprocal ST-segment depression maximal in lead V4 (-0.40 ± 0.16 mV, P = .005). Simultaneous LAD and RCA occlusion reduced ST-segment elevation by about 60{\%} and blunted reciprocal ST-segment changes. Reperfusion of 1 of the 2 occluded arteries induced immediate regional reversion of ST-segment elevation with concurrent beat-to-beat re-elevation in the opposite ischemic region and reappearance of reciprocal ST-segment changes. In the isolated heart, single LAD or RCA ligature induced regional transmural ST-segment elevation that was maximal in endocardial electrograms with no appreciable reciprocal ST-segment depression. Simultaneous LAD and RCA ligature reduced ST-segment elevation by about 30{\%} with no appreciable re-elevation after 1-vessel selective reperfusion.
CONCLUSION: Acute myocardial ischemia in opposite ventricular regions attenuated ST-segment elevation and blunted reciprocal depression in conventional ECG leads but not in direct local myocardial electrograms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We describe a noninvasive method of detecting and quantifying left atrial (LA) wall injury after pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Using a 3-dimensional (3D) delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence and novel processing methods, LA wall scarring is visualized at high resolution after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation to achieve PVAI is a promising approach to curing AF. Controlled lesion delivery and scar formation within the LA are indicators of procedural success, but the assessment of these factors is limited to invasive methods. Noninvasive evaluation of LA wall injury to assess permanent tissue injury may be an important step in improving procedural success.

METHODS: Imaging of the LA wall with a 3D delayed-enhanced cardiac MRI sequence was performed before and 3 months after ablation in 46 patients undergoing PVAI for AF. Our 3D respiratory-navigated MRI sequence using parallel imaging resulted in 1.25 x 1.25 x 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.6 x 0.6 x 1.25 mm) spatial resolution with imaging times ranging 8 to 12 min.

RESULTS: Radiofrequency ablation resulted in hyperenhancement of the LA wall in all patients post-PVAI and may represent tissue scarring. New methods of reconstructing the LA in 3D allowed quantification of LA scarring using automated methods. Arrhythmia recurrence at 3 months correlated with the degree of wall enhancement with {\textgreater}13{\%} injury predicting freedom from AF (odds ratio: 18.5, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.27 to 268, p = 0.032).

CONCLUSIONS: We define noninvasive MRI methods that allow for the detection and quantification of LA wall scarring after RF ablation in patients with AF. Moreover, there seems to be a correlation between the extent of LA wall injury and short-term procedural outcome.},

abstract = {Background Regional disparities of ventricular primary-repolarization properties contribute to an electrophysiological substrate for arrhythmias. Such disparities can be assessed from body-surface distributions of ECG QRST areas. Our objective was to isolate and test those features of QRST-area distributions that would be suitable for identifying patients at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Methods and Results We recorded ECGs simultaneously from 120 leads during sinus rhythm for 204 patients taking no antiarrhythmic drugs: half had had sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT); the other half, a myocardial infarction but no history of VT. For each patient, we calculated the QRST area in each lead and, using Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion, reduced these data to 16 coefficients (each relating to one spatial feature, an eigenvector, derived from the total set of 204 QRST-area maps). Using stepwise discriminant analysis, we selected feature subsets that best discriminated between the two groups, and we estimated by a bootstrap procedure using 1000 trials how these subsets would perform on a prospective patient population. The mean diagnostic performance of the classifier for 1000 randomly selected training sets (n=102 in each, with both groups equally represented) increased monotonically with the number of features used for classification. The initial trend for the corresponding test sets (n=102 in each) was the same but reversed when the number of features exceeded eight. For an optimal set of eight spatial features, the sensitivity and specificity of the classifier for detecting patients with VT in 1000 test sets were (mean±SD) 90.3±4.3{\%} and 78.0±6.1{\%}, and its positive and negative predictive accuracies were 80.7±4.2{\%} and 89.2±4.2{\%}, respectively. Use of QRS duration as a supplementary feature to eight K-L coefficients can, in the test sets, increase specificity to 80.9±5.4{\%} and positive predictive accuracy to 82.8±3.9{\%} compared with the results for the optimal number of eight K-L features alone. Conclusions Multiple body-surface ECGs contain valuable spatial features that can identify the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate in the myocardium of patients at risk for ventricular arrhythmias.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A widened QRS complex as a primary indication for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure patients has been reported to be an inconsistent indicator for dyssynchronous ventricular activation. The purpose of this study was to conduct a detailed experimental investigation of total ventricular activation time (TVAT), determine how to measure it accurately, and compare it to the commonly used measure of QRS width. In addition, we investigated a measure of electrical synchrony and determined its relationship to the duration of ventricular activation. METHODS: Unipolar electrograms (EGs) were recorded from the myocardial volume using plunge needle electrodes, from the epicardial surface using "sock" electrode arrays, and from the surface of an electrolytic torso-shaped tank. EGs were analyzed to determine a root mean square (RMS)-based measure of ventricular activation and electrical ventricular synchrony. RESULTS: The RMS-based technique provided an accurate means of measuring TVAT from unipolar EGs recorded from the heart, the entire tank surface, or the precordial leads. In normal canine hearts, a quantification of ventricular electrical synchrony (VES) for normal ventricular activation showed that the ventricles activate, on average, within 3 ms of each other with the left typically activating first. CONCLUSION: Conclusions from this study are: (1) ventricular activation was reflected accurately by the RMS width obtained from direct cardiac measurements and from precordial leads on the tank surface and (2) VES was not strongly correlated with TVAT.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Myocardial ischemia is a pathological condition initiated by supply and demand imbalance of the blood to the heart. Previous studies suggest that ischemia originates in the subendocardium, i.e., that nontransmural ischemia is limited to the subendocardium. By contrast, we hypothesized that acute myocardial ischemia is not limited to the subendocardium and sought to document its spatial distribution in an animal preparation. The goal of these experiments was to investigate the spatial organization of ischemia and its relationship to the resulting shifts in ST segment potentials during short episodes of acute ischemia. METHODS We conducted acute ischemia studies in open-chest canines (N=19) and swines (N=10), which entailed creating carefully controlled ischemia using demand, supply or complete occlusion ischemia protocols and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. Elevation of the potentials at 40{\%} of the ST segment between the J-point and the peak of the T-wave (ST40{\%}) provided the metric for local ischemia. The threshold for ischemic ST segment elevations was defined as two standard deviations away from the baseline values. RESULTS The relative frequency of occurrence of acute ischemia was higher in the subendocardium (78{\%} for canines and 94{\%} for swines) and the mid-wall (87{\%} for canines and 97{\%} for swines) in comparison with the subepicardium (30{\%} for canines and 22{\%} for swines). In addition, acute ischemia was seen arising throughout the myocardium (distributed pattern) in 87{\%} of the canine and 94{\%} of the swine episodes. Alternately, acute ischemia was seen originating only in the subendocardium (subendocardial pattern) in 13{\%} of the canine episodes and 6{\%} of the swine episodes (p{\textless}0.05).

abstract = {The clinical significance of stress-induced ST-segment elevation and T- wave pseudonormalization in infarct-related leads is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted the present study to assess this issue using simultaneous dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography. A total of 119 patients with Q- wave myocardial infarction were enrolled in this study. There were 58 patients with (group I) and 61 patients without (group II) dobutamine- induced ST-T changes. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 43 ± 13{\%} in group I and 49 ± 14{\%} in group II (p {\textless}0.05). The baseline, low-, and peak- dose global wall motion scores were similar between these 2 groups (26.2 ± 6.1 vs 26.2 ± 6.3 [p = NS]; 24.1 5.3 vs 23.5 ± 5.7 [p = NS]; 26.4 ± 5.7 vs 26.7 6.1 [p = NS]). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these ST-T changes for detecting residual myocardial viability and ischemia documented by DSE in all patients were 50{\%}, 53{\%}, and 51{\%} (for viability), and 47{\%}, 48{\%}, and 47{\%} (for ischemia), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these ST-T changes for detecting a reversible perfusion defect documented by thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography were 51{\%}, 54{\%}, and 52{\%}, respectively. In conclusion, dobutamine-induced ST elevation and/or T-wave pseudonormalization is associated with poor resting left ventricular function. These ST-T changes are not associated with residual myocardial ischemia and viability in the infarct area. Therefore, these electrocardiographic changes alone cannot be reliably considered as distinctive markers in formulating the therapeutic strategy of coronary intervention.},

abstract = {Cardiac myocytes rapidly proliferate during fetal life but exit the cell cycle soon after birth in mammals. Although the extent to which adult cardiac myocytes are capable of cell cycle reentry is controversial and species-specific differences may exist, it appears that for the vast majority of adult cardiac myocytes the predominant form of growth postnatally is an increase in cell size (hypertrophy) not number. Unfortunately, this limits the ability of the heart to restore function after any significant injury. Interest in novel regenerative therapies has led to the accumulation of much information on the mechanisms that regulate the rapid proliferation of cardiac myocytes in utero, their cell cycle exit in the perinatal period, and the permanent arrest (terminal differentiation) in adult myocytes. The recent identification of cardiac progenitor cells capable of giving rise to cardiac myocyte-like cells has challenged the dogma that the heart is a terminally differentiated organ and opened new prospects for cardiac regeneration. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of cardiomyocyte cell cycle control in normal development and disease. In addition, we also discuss the potential usefulness of cardiomyocyte self-renewal as well as feasibility of therapeutic manipulation of the cardiac myocyte cell cycle for cardiac regeneration.},

abstract = {We have studied the three-dimensional arrangement of ventricular muscle cells and the associated extracellular connective tissue matrix in dog hearts. Four hearts were potassium-arrested, excised, and perfusion-fixed at zero transmural pressure. Full-thickness segments were cut from the right and left ventricular walls at a series of precisely located sites. Morphology was visualized macroscopically and with scanning electron microscopy in 1) transmural planes of section and 2) planes tangential to the epicardial surface. The appearance of all specimens was consistent with an ordered laminar arrangement of myocytes with extensive cleavage planes between muscle layers. These planes ran radially from endocardium toward epicardium in transmural section and coincided with the local muscle fiber orientation in tangential section. Stereological techniques were used to quantify aspects of this organization. There was no consistent variation in the cellular organization of muscle layers (48.4 +/- 20.4 microns thick and 4 +/- 2 myocytes across) transmurally or in different ventricular regions (23 sites in 6 segments), but there was significant transmural variation in the coupling between adjacent layers. The number of branches between layers decreased twofold from subepicardium to midwall, whereas the length distribution of perimysial collagen fibers connecting muscle layers was greatest in the midwall. We conclude that ventricular myocardium is not a uniformly branching continuum but a laminar hierarchy in which it is possible to identify three axes of material symmetry at any point.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose Automated measurements of electrocardiographic (ECG) intervals are widely used by clinicians for individual patient diagnosis and by investigators in population studies. We examined whether clinically significant systematic differences exist in ECG intervals measured by current generation digital electrocardiographs from different manufacturers and whether differences, if present, are dependent on the degree of abnormality of the selected ECGs. Methods Measurements of RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval were made blindly by 4 major manufacturers of digital electrocardiographs used in the United States from 600 XML files of ECG tracings stored in the US FDA ECG warehouse and released for the purpose of this study by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. Included were 3 groups based on expected QT interval and degree of repolarization abnormality, comprising 200 ECGs each from (1) placebo or baseline study period in normal subjects during thorough QT studies, (2) peak moxifloxacin effect in otherwise normal subjects during thorough QT studies, and (3) patients with genotyped variants of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). Results Differences of means between manufacturers were generally small in the normal and moxifloxacin subjects, but in the LQTS patients, differences of means ranged from 2.0 to 14.0 ms for QRS duration and from 0.8 to 18.1 ms for the QT interval. Mean absolute differences between algorithms were similar for QRS duration and QT intervals in the normal and in the moxifloxacin subjects (mean ≤6 ms) but were significantly larger in patients with LQTS. Conclusions Small but statistically significant group differences in mean interval and duration measurements and means of individual absolute differences exist among automated algorithms of widely used, current generation digital electrocardiographs. Measurement differences, including QRS duration and the QT interval, are greatest for the most abnormal ECGs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Mosby, Inc.},

abstract = {Regulation of chromatin structure via histone modification has recently received intense attention. Here, we demonstrate that the chromatin-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 2 (Hdac2) functions with a small homeodomain factor, Hopx, to mediate deacetylation of Gata4, which is expressed by cardiac progenitor cells and plays critical roles in the regulation of cardiogenesis. In the absence of Hopx and Hdac2 in mouse embryos, Gata4 hyperacetylation is associated with a marked increase in cardiac myocyte proliferation, upregulation of Gata4 target genes, and perinatal lethality. Hdac2 physically interacts with Gata4, and this interaction is stabilized by Hopx. The ability of Gata4 to transactivate cell cycle genes is impaired by Hopx/Hdac2-mediated deacetylation, and this effect is abrogated by loss of Hdac2-Gata4 interaction. These results suggest that Gata4 is a nonhistone target of Hdac2-mediated deacetylation and that Hdac2, Hopx, and Gata4 coordinately regulate cardiac myocyte proliferation during embryonic development. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Dicer mutant mice show misexpression of cardiac contractile proteins and profound sarcomere disarray. Functional analyses indicate significantly reduced heart rates and decreased fractional shortening of Dicer mutant hearts. Consistent with the role of Dicer in animal hearts, Dicer expression was decreased in end-stage human DCM and failing hearts and, most importantly, a significant increase of Dicer expression was observed in those hearts after left ventricle assist devices were inserted to improve cardiac function. Together, our studies demonstrate essential roles for Dicer in cardiac contraction and indicate that miRNAs play critical roles in normal cardiac function and under pathological conditions.},

The interpretation of activation wavefronts and their propagation can identify mechanistic properties of a broad range of electrophysiological pathologies. However, the sparsity, distribution and uncertainty of recorded data make accurate conduction velocity calculation difficult. A wide range of mathematical approaches have been proposed for addressing this challenge, often targeted towards specific data modalities, species or recording environments. Many of these algorithms require identification of activation times from electrogram recordings which themselves may have complex morphology or low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper surveys algorithms designed for identifying local activation times and computing conduction direction and speed. Their suitability for use in different recording contexts and applications is assessed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The goal of noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is to determine electric activity of the heart by reconstructing maps of epicardial potentials, excitation times (isochrones), and electrograms from data measured on the body surface. METHODS AND RESULTS Local electrocardiac events were initiated by pacing a dog heart in a human torso-shaped tank. Body surface potential measurements (384 electrodes) were used to compute epicardial potentials noninvasively. The accuracy of reconstructed epicardial potentials was evaluated by direct comparison to measured ones (134 electrodes). Protocols included pacing from single sites and simultaneously from two sites with various intersite distances. Body surface potentials showed a single minimum for both single- and double-site pacing (intersite distances of 52, 35, and 17 mm). Noninvasively reconstructed epicardial electrograms, potentials, and isochrones closely approximated the measured ones. Single pacing sites were reconstructed to within {\textless} or = 10 mm of their measured positions. Dual sites were located accurately and resolved for the above intersite distances. Regions of sparse and crowded isochrones, indicating spatial nonuniformities of epicardial activation spread, were also reconstructed. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrates that ECGI can reconstruct epicardial potentials, electrograms, and isochrones over the entire epicardial surface during the cardiac cycle. It can provide detailed information on local activation of the heart noninvasively. Its uses could include localization of cardiac electric events (eg, ectopic foci), characterization of nonuniformities of conduction, characterization of repolarization properties (eg, dispersion), and mapping of dynamically changing arrhythmias (eg, polymorphic VT) on a beat-by-beat basis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although in vitro studies have suggested that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) might be involved in vascular biology, its potential role in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of atherosclerosis has not been investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Both recombinant human TRAIL and an adeno-associated virus vector expressing human TRAIL were used to deliver TRAIL in apolipoprotein E (apoE)-null mice in which diabetes mellitus was induced by destruction of islet cells with streptozotocin. Diabetes in apoE-null mice was associated with a significant increase in atherosclerotic plaque area and complexity in the aorta as assessed by a marked increase in interstitial collagen, cellular proliferation, and macrophage infiltration and a focal loss of endothelial coverage. Repeated intraperitoneal injections of recombinant human TRAIL and a single intravenous injection of adeno-associated virus-human TRAIL significantly attenuated the development of atherosclerotic plaques in apoE-null animals. TRAIL also markedly affected the cellular composition of plaque lesions by inducing apoptosis of infiltrating macrophages and increasing the vascular smooth muscle cell content. Moreover, TRAIL promoted the in vitro migration of cultured human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells but not of monocytes or macrophages. Conversely, TRAIL selectively induced apoptosis of human cultured macrophages but not of vascular smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, data from the present study indicate that atherosclerosis in diabetic apoE-null mice is ameliorated by systemic TRAIL administration and that adeno-associated virus-mediated TRAIL gene delivery might represent an innovative method for the therapy of diabetic vascular diseases.},

abstract = {An automated method for left ventricle detection in MR cardiac images is presented. Ventricle detection is the first step in a fully automated segmentation system used to compute volumetric information about the heart. Our method is based on learning the gray level appearance of the ventricle by maximizing the discrimination between positive and negative examples in a training set. The main differences from previously reported methods are feature definition and solution to the optimization problem involved in the learning process. Our method was trained on a set of 1,350 MR cardiac images from which 101,250 positive examples and 123,096 negative examples were generated. The detection results on a test set of 887 different images demonstrate an excellent performance: 98{\%} detection rate, a false alarm rate of 0.05{\%} of the number of windows analyzed (10 false alarms per image) and a detection time of 2 seconds per 256{\&}times;256 image on a Sun Ultra 10 for an 8-scale search. The false alarms ore eventually eliminated by a position/scale consistency check along all the images that represent the same anatomical slice},

abstract = {The His-Purkinje conduction system initiates the normal excitation of the ventricles and is a major component of the specialized conduction system of the heart. Abnormalities and propagation blocks in the Purkinje system result in abnormal excitation of the heart. Experimental findings suggest that the Purkinje network plays an important role in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which is the major cause of sudden cardiac death. Nowadays an important area in the study of cardiac arrhythmias is anatomically accurate modelling. The majority of current anatomical models have not included a description of the Purkinje network. As a consequence, these models cannot be used to study the important role of the Purkinje system in arrhythmia initiation and maintenance. In this article we provide an overview of previous work on modelling of the Purkinje system and report on the development of a His-Purkinje system for our human ventricular model. We use the model to simulate the normal activation pattern as well as abnormal activation patterns resulting from bundle branch block and bundle branch reentry. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{MacLeod2001,
abstract = {Despite many years of study, certain aspects of myocardial ischemia remain incompletely understood. One observation that motivated this study is that acute, complete occlusion produces elevations but never depression of the ST-segment potentials in electrocardiographic leads over the ischemic zone. Limited flow, on the other hand, leads to ST-segment depression, both in in situ experiments and during clinical stress tests. The prevailing biophysical theory of ischemia suggests that complete occlusion should produce at least transient ST-segment depression, a finding we have neither observed in our own studies nor uncovered in the literature. Our goal with these experiments was to understand the difference between complete occlusion and reduced coronary flow, specifically the behavior at the transition between the two. We have performed experiments by using isolated dog hearts with a cannulated left anterior descending artery suspended in a human shaped electrolytic tank. To create a range of ischemic conditions, we changed coronary flow rates both suddenly and in controlled sequences and varied the heart rate of the isolated heart. The main finding was that in the isolated heart preparation, epicardial ST-segment depression over the ischemic zone arose only under conditions of combined restricted flow and elevated heart rate. Reduced coronary flow alone never produced ST-segment depression. These findings suggest that heart rate and probably metabolic work create the conditions necessary for subendocardial ischemia that reduced flow alone cannot provoke. They furthermore suggest that the degree of ST-segment depression for a given restriction in coronary flow may depend on heart rate, which supports the notion of rate correction for clinical stress electrocardiogram testing.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives. Rapid risk stratification of the patient with acute chest pain is essential to select the best management. We investigated the value of the ECG at first medical contact to determine size of the ischaemic myocardial area and thereby severity of risk.Methods. In 386 patients with acute chest pain, ECG findings were correlated with the coronary angiogram. Using ST-segment deviation patterns the location of the coronary culprit lesion was predicted and thereby size of the area at risk. Four groups of patients were present. Those with a narrow QRS and a total 12-lead ST-segment deviation score of {\textgreater}/=5 mm (group 1) or {\textless}/=4 mm (group 2); a QRS width of {\textgreater}/=120 ms (group 3), and patients with previous coronary bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (group 4).Results. Correct coronary culprit lesion localisation was possible in 84{\%} of the 185 patients in group 1, 40{\%} of the total cohort. Accurate prediction was not possible in most patients in groups 2, 3 and 4, in spite of extensive coronary artery disease in group 3 and 4. Conclusions. Using the 12-lead ECG the size of the myocardial area at risk can be accurately predicted when the total ST-segment deviation score is {\textgreater}/=5 mm, allowing identification of those in need of a PCI. In most patients with bundle branch block, previous CABG or PCI, the ECG can not localise the culprit lesion. This approach simplifies and accelerates decision-making at first medical contact.

abstract = {Distinguishing between the two enantiomers of a molecule is a challenging task due to their nearly identical physical properties. Time-consuming chromatography methods are typically required for this task, which greatly limits the throughput of analysis. Here we describe a fluorescence-based method for the rapid and high-throughput analysis of both small-molecule enantiopurity and concentration. Our approach relies on selective molecular recognition of one enantiomer of the target molecule using a DNA aptamer, and the ability of aptamer-based biosensors to transduce the presence of a target molecule into a dose-dependent fluorescence signal. The key novel aspect of our approach is the implementation of enantiomeric DNA biosensors, which are synthesized from d- and l-DNA, but labeled with orthogonal fluorophores. According to the principle of reciprocal chiral substrate specificity, these biosensors will bind to opposite enantiomers of the target with equal affinity and selectivity, enabling simultaneous quantification of both enantiomers of the target. Using the previously reported DNA biosensor for l-tyrosinamide (l-Tym), we demonstrate the ability to rapidly and accurately measure both enantiopurity and concentration for mixtures of l- and d-Tym. We also apply our enantiomeric biosensors to the optimization of reaction conditions for the synthesis of d-Tym and provide mathematical modeling to suggest that DNA biosensors having only modest binding selectivity can also be used for fluorescence-based enantiopurity measurement. This research provides a generalizable method for high-throughput analysis of reaction mixtures, which is anticipated to significantly accelerate reaction optimization for the synthesis of high-value chiral small molecules.},

abstract = {The switch from myocyte hyperplasia to hypertrophy occurs during the early postnatal period. The exact temporal sequence when cardiac myocytes cease dividing and become terminally differentiated is not certain, although it is currently believed that the transition takes place gradually over a 1-2-week period. The present investigation has characterized the growth pattern of cardiac myocytes during the early postnatal period. Cardiac myocytes were enzymatically isolated from the hearts of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12-day-old rats for the measurements of binucleation, cell volume and myocyte number. Almost all myocytes were mononucleated and cell volume remained relatively constant during the first 3 days of age. Increases in cell volume and binucleation of myocytes were first detected at day 4. Myocyte volume increased 2.5-fold from day 3 to day 12 (1416 +/- 320 compared to 3533 +/- 339 microns 3). The percentage of binucleated myocytes began to increase at day 4 and proceeded at a high rate, reaching the adult level of approximately 90{\%} at day 12. Myocyte number increased 68{\%} during the first 3 days (from 13.6 +/- 3.5 x 10(6) at day 1 to 22.9 +/- 5.6 x 10(10) at day 3) and remained constant thereafter. To confirm that no further myocyte division exists after 4 days, bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) was administered to 4-day-old rats and the fate of DNA-synthesizing myocytes was examined 2 h and 2, 4, 6 and 8 days after Brdu injection. About 12{\%} of myocytes were labeled with Brdu at 2 h and all were mononucleated at that time. Gradually, these Brdu-labeled myocytes became binucleated. However, the percentage of labeled myocytes in all groups was identical, indicating that DNA-synthesizing myocytes were becoming binucleated without further cell division after 4 days of age. Within 8 days after injection, approximately 82{\%} of total labeled myocytes were binucleated, while the others remained mononucleated. Sarcomeric alpha-actinin was fully disassembled in dividing myocytes of 2-day-old rats, while typical alpha-actinin striations were present in dividing myocytes of 4-day-old rats. The results from this study suggest that a rapid switch from myocyte hyperplasia to hypertrophy occurs between postnatal day 3 and 4 in rat hearts.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitously employed as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for patients experiencing cardiac distress and/or disease. It is widely known that changes in heart position resulting from, for example, posture of the patient (sitting, standing, lying) and respiration significantly affect the body-surface potentials; however, few studies have quantitatively and systematically evaluated the effects of heart displacement on the ECG. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of positional changes of the heart on the ECG in the specific clinical setting of myocardial ischemia. To carry out the necessary comprehensive sensitivity analysis, we applied a relatively novel and highly efficient statistical approach, the generalized polynomial chaos-stochastic collocation method, to a boundary element formulation of the electrocardiographic forward problem, and we drove these simulations with measured epicardial potentials from whole-heart experiments. Results of the analysis identified regions on the body-surface where the potentials were especially sensitive to realistic heart motion. The standard deviation (STD) of ST-segment voltage changes caused by the apex of a normal heart, swinging forward and backward or side-to-side was approximately 0.2 mV. Variations were even larger, 0.3 mV, for a heart exhibiting elevated ischemic potentials. These variations could be large enough to mask or to mimic signs of ischemia in the ECG. Our results suggest possible modifications to ECG protocols that could reduce the diagnostic error related to postural changes in patients possibly suffering from myocardial ischemia.},

After LAD occlusion 1) T-Q segment depression and S-T segment elevation showed a faster rate of development, and monophasic potentials occurred earlier in the endocardium than in the epicardium; 2) T-Q segment depression was greater at the center than at the periphery of the ischemic area during the first 20-30 min, and later it became greater at the periphery than at the center; and 3) a period of transient recovery in the local activation beginning after 8-15 min and lasting for 10-20 min occurred in all cases, commonly associated with T-wave alternans. LAD embolization with latex induced greater T-Q and S-T segment changes in the epicardium than in the endocardium, increased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation, and failed to impede the appearance of the period of transient electrical recovery. Thus, within an acutely ischemic area in the in situ pig heart, there are inhomogeneities in the magnitude and time course of the electrical changes, which are not prevented by procedures able to block collateral blood flow to the ischemic area. Ventricular fibrillation was also not prevented by such a procedure.},

abstract = {AIMS: Optogenetics approaches, utilizing light-sensitive proteins, have emerged as unique experimental paradigms to modulate neuronal excitability. We aimed to evaluate whether a similar strategy could be used to control cardiac-tissue excitability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A combined cell and gene therapy strategy was developed in which fibroblasts were transfected to express the light-activated depolarizing channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Patch-clamp studies confirmed the development of a robust inward current in the engineered fibroblasts following monochromatic blue-light exposure. The engineered cells were co-cultured with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (or human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes) and studied using a multielectrode array mapping technique. These studies revealed the ability of the ChR2-fibroblasts to electrically couple and pace the cardiomyocyte cultures at varying frequencies in response to blue-light flashes. Activation mapping pinpointed the source of this electrical activity to the engineered cells. Similarly, diffuse seeding of the ChR2-fibroblasts allowed multisite optogenetics pacing of the co-cultures, significantly shortening their electrical activation time and synchronizing contraction. Next, optogenetics pacing in an in vitro model of conduction block allowed the resynchronization of the tissue's electrical activity. Finally, the ChR2-fibroblasts were transfected to also express the light-sensitive hyperpolarizing proton pump Archaerhodopsin-T (Arch-T). Seeding of the ChR2/ArchT-fibroblasts allowed to either optogentically pace the cultures (in response to blue-light flashes) or completely suppress the cultures' electrical activity (following continuous illumination with 624 nm monochromatic light, activating ArchT).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this proof-of-concept study highlight the unique potential of optogenetics for future biological pacemaking and resynchronization therapy applications and for the development of novel anti-arrhythmic strategies.},

abstract = {Objetives. This study was designed to establish the appropriate diagnostic criteria for positive dobutamine electrocardiographic (ECG) stress test results and to compare their accuracy with those of dobutamine two-dimensional echocardiography and perfusion scintigraphy. Background. Conventional criteria for positive findings on ECG exercise testing may not be appropriate for use with dobutamine ECG stress testing. Methods. One hundred twenty-nine consecutive patients with an interpretable ECG and without previous myocardial infarction were prospectively studied at the time of coronary arteriography. All completed a standard dobutamine protocol (5 to 40 ??g/kg body weight per min in 3-min dose increments) without side effects. Significant coronary artery disease, defined as {\textgreater}50{\%} lumen diameter stenosis of a major epicardial coronary artery on coronary angiography, was present in 83 patients. Empiric receiver operating curves were generated for various ECG criteria derived from computer-averaged signals. Results. The best ECG criterion, with a sensitivity of 42{\%} and a specificity of 83{\%}, was an ST segment shift, relative to baseline, of 0.5 mm 80 ms after the J point. The sensitivity of this criterion was greater than that of the conventional criterion of 1-mm ST segment depression 60 (23{\%}) or 80 (18{\%}) ms after the J point, was comparable to that of chest pain occurring during the test (44{\%}, p = NS) but remained inferior to the sensitivities of technetium99m methoxyl isobutyl isonitrile (mibi) perfusion (76{\%}) or stress echocardiography (76{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001, for both). The specificity of this criterion was not significantly different from that of technetium-99m mibi perfusion tomography (65{\%}) or stress echocardiography (89{\%}) but was superior to that of chest pain (59{\%}, p {\textless} 0.025). Conclusions. We conclude that this new criterion for dobutamine electrocardiography is specific but that an imaging technique is still required to accurately predict coronary artery disease. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {We investigated whether spontaneous normalization of negative T waves (TWN) on infarct-related ECG leads (IRLs) in the chronic phase of Q wave anterior myocardial infarction (MI) could be a predictor of residual viability in infarct areas. We prospectively studied 35 patients (age 60 +/- 8.6 years) in the chronic phase of Q wave anterior MI. Spontaneous TWN (group A, n = 23) were defined as negative T waves that became upright ({\textgreater} or =0.15 mV) in {\textgreater} or =2 IRLs. The presence of negative T waves (group B, n = 12) was defined as symmetric or biphasic negative T wave of {\textgreater} or =0.15 mV. All patients underwent same-day rest 201Tl-stress (99m)Tc sestamibi dual-isotope myocardial perfusion SPECT and 24-hour 201Tl reinjection imaging for ischemia and viability analysis. On scintigraphic examination, ischemic or viable myocardial segments were found in 18 patients (78{\%}) with TWN and 4 patients (33{\%}) of group B (p = 0.013). The use of TWN as a parameter had a marked influence on the sensitivity (82{\%}), specificity (62{\%}), positive (78{\%}) and negative (67{\%}) predictive values and accuracy (74{\%}) of the diagnosis of viable myocardium. If we add the criterion of positive T waves in aVR with negative T waves to our criteria, we found that sensitivity (90{\%}), positive (80{\%}) and negative (80{\%}) predictive values and accuracy (80{\%}) increased. The results of our study suggest that analysis of TWN on IRLs is an accurate marker of residual viability and/or persistent peri-infarct ischemia in patients in the chronic stage of Q wave anterior MI, and therefore optimizes the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies after MI.},

Serum samples were obtained from 6 groups of dogs: (1) normal adult dogs (n = 15); (2) dogs with asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 5); (3) dogs with congestive heart failure (n = 10); (4) dogs with untreated neoplasia (n = 20); (5) dogs with skeletal muscle trauma (n = 10); and (6) dogs with neoplasia receiving doxorubicin chemotherapy (n = 4). One serum sample was obtained from each of the normal dogs, those with asymptomatic cardiomyopathy, those with congestive heart failure, and those with untreated neoplasia. Serum samples were obtained serially from the dogs that were undergoing doxorubicin chemotherapy; samples were collected before doxorubicin (30 mg/m2) administration and then 1, 5, 7, and 14 days after administration throughout 6 cycles for a cumulative total dose of 180 mg/m2. All normal dogs, dogs with untreated neoplasia, and dogs with asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy had cTnT concentrations below the lower limits of detection for the assay used ({\textless}0.05 ng/mL). Detectable concentrations of cTnT were found in 3 dogs with congestive heart failure and in 2 dogs with skeletal muscle trauma. Detectable concentrations also were found in both dogs that had received 180 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. We conclude that dogs with congestive heart failure and those with skeletal muscle trauma and dogs with neoplasia receiving high-dose doxorubicin chemotherapy may have increased serum cTnT concentration, which may be suggestive of myocardial damage.},

abstract = {The ST segment/heart rate (ST/HR) slope is a recently developed method of analysis of the exercise electrocardiogram that can improve test sensitivity for the detection of coronary artery disease and can identify patients with anatomically and functionally severe coronary obstruction with significantly greater accuracy than is currently available using standard test criteria. The ST/HR slope, in effect, normalizes the amount of exercise-induced ST segment depression for the corresponding change in heart rate. Since heart rate is strongly related to myocardial oxygen demand during exercise, the ST/HR slope provides an estimate of the extent of disease based on correction of the electrocardiographic estimate of myocardial ischemia for associated increments in myocardial work. Sensitivity of the ST/HR slope for the detection of coronary disease in a population of patients with stable angina was 91{\%}, compared with only 57{\%} using standard test criteria. Further, an ST/HR slope partition for the recognition of three-vessel coronary disease had a senstivity of 78{\%}, specificity of 97{\%}, and positive predictive value of 93{\%} in patients with stable angina. However, test sensitivity was significantly reduced following recent myocardial infarction, while test specificity was significantly reduced in patients with aortic regurgitation but who had normal coronary arteries. Thus, while limitation of the method must be recognized, the ST/HR slope has important diagnostic power in patients with stable angina.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND With its inherent limitations, determining local activation times has been the basis of cardiac mapping for over a century. Here, we introduce omnipolar electrograms that originate from the natural direction of a travelling wave and from which instantaneous conduction velocity amplitude and direction can be computed at any single location without first determining activation times. We sought to validate omnipole-derived conduction velocities and explore potential application for localization of sources of arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS Electrograms from omnipolar mapping were derived and validated using 4 separate models and 2 independent signal acquisition methodologies. We used both electric signals and optical signals collected from monolayer cell preparations, 3-dimensional constructs built with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells, simultaneous optical and electric mapping of rabbit hearts, and in vivo pig electrophysiology studies. Conduction velocities calculated from omnipolar electrograms were compared with wavefront propagation from optical and electric-mapping studies with a traditional local activation time-based method. Bland-Altman analysis revealed that omnipolar measurements on optical data were in agreement with local activation time methods for wavefront direction and velocity within 25 cm/s and 30°, respectively. Similar agreement was also found on electric data. Furthermore, mathematical operations, such as curl and divergence, were applied to omnipole-derived velocity vector fields to locate rotational and focal sources, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Electrode orientation-independent cardiac wavefront trajectory and speed at a single location for each cardiac activation can be determined accurately with omnipolar electrograms. Omnipole-derived vector fields, when combined with mathematical transforms may aid in real-time detection of cardiac activation sources.},

abstract = {We propose an automatic four-chamber heart segmentation system for the quantitative functional analysis of the heart from cardiac computed tomography (CT) volumes. Two topics are discussed: heart modeling and automatic model fitting to an unseen volume. Heart modeling is a nontrivial task since the heart is a complex nonrigid organ. The model must be anatomically accurate, allow manual editing, and provide sufficient information to guide automatic detection and segmentation. Unlike previous work, we explicitly represent important landmarks (such as the valves and the ventricular septum cusps) among the control points of the model. The control points can be detected reliably to guide the automatic model fitting process. Using this model, we develop an efficient and robust approach for automatic heart chamber segmentation in 3-D CT volumes. We formulate the segmentation as a two-step learning problem: anatomical structure localization and boundary delineation. In both steps, we exploit the recent advances in learning discriminative models. A novel algorithm, marginal space learning (MSL), is introduced to solve the 9-D similarity transformation search problem for localizing the heart chambers. After determining the pose of the heart chambers, we estimate the 3-D shape through learning-based boundary delineation. The proposed method has been extensively tested on the largest dataset (with 323 volumes from 137 patients) ever reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the fastest with a speed of 4.0 s per volume (on a dual-core 3.2-GHz processor) for the automatic segmentation of all four chambers.},

abstract = {Background Recent randomized evidence has demonstrated benefit with complete revascularization during the index hospitalization for multivessel coronary artery disease ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients; however, this benefit likely depends on the risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Methods Using data from Duke University Medical Center (2003-2012), we identified those at high risk for 1-year MACE among 664 STEMI patients with conservatively managed non–infarct-related artery (non-IRA) lesions. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified clinical and angiographic characteristics associated with MACE (death, myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization) to 1 year and developed an integer-based risk prediction model for clinical use. Results In this cohort (median age 60 years, 30{\%} female), the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier rates for MACE at 30 days and 1 year were 10{\%} and 28{\%}, respectively. Characteristics associated with MACE at 1 year included reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, hypertension, heart failure, higher-risk non-IRA vessels (left main), renal insufficiency, and greater {\%} stenosis of non-IRA lesions. A 15-point risk score including these variables had modest discrimination (C-index 0.67) across a spectrum of subsequent risk (4{\%}-88{\%}) for 1-year MACE. Conclusions There is a wide spectrum of risk following primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI patients with multivessel disease. Using readily available clinical characteristics, the expected incidence of MACE by 1 year can be calculated with a simplified risk score, facilitating a tailored approach to clinical care.},

abstract = {Ganglionated plexuses (GPs) are major constituents of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system, the final common integrator of regional cardiac control. We hypothesized that nicotinic stimulation of individual GPs exerts divergent regional influences, affecting atrial as well as ventricular functions. In 22 anesthetized canines, unipolar electrograms were recorded from 127 atrial and 127 ventricular epicardial loci during nicotine injection (100??mcg in 0.1??ml) into either the 1) right atrial (RA), 2) dorsal atrial, 3) left atrial, 4) inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial, 5) right ventricular, 6) ventral septal ventricular or 7) cranial medial ventricular (CMV) GP. In addition to sinus and AV nodal function, neural effects on atrial and ventricular repolarization were identified as changes in the area subtended by unipolar recordings under basal conditions and at maximum neurally-induced effects. Animals were studied with intact AV node or following ablation to achieve ventricular rate control. Atrial rate was affected in response to stimulation of all 7 GPs with an incidence of 50-95{\%} of the animals among the different GPs. AV conduction was affected following stimulation of 6/7 GP with an incidence of 22-75{\%} among GPs. Atrial and ventricular repolarization properties were affected by atrial as well as ventricular GP stimulation. Distinct regional patterns of repolarization changes were identified in response to stimulation of individual GPs. RAGP predominantly affected the RA and posterior right ventricular walls whereas CMVGP elicited biatrial and biventricular repolarization changes. Spatially divergent and overlapping cardiac regions are affected in response to nicotinic stimulation of neurons in individual GPs. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this work was to target a vital reporter gene in the mouse cardiac conduction system (CS) to distinguish this tissue from the surrounding myocardium in the adult heart. Methods: A transgenic mouse line has been created in which EGFP is expressed under the control of the Cx40 gene. Correlative investigations associating EGFP imaging and electrophysiological techniques were carried out on the adult heart and isolated cardiomyocytes. Results: In the heart of the Cx40EGFP/+ mice, EGFP signal was seen in the coronary arteries, the atria, the atrioventricular (AV) node and the His-Purkinje system. The latter was found to be structurally and functionally asymmetrical. The anatomical asymmetry was apparent in both the number of strands or fasciculi making up the His bundle branches (BBs) (1 strand on the right, 20 or so on the left), and the density (low on the right, high on the left) of the network of Purkinje fibers (PFs) that extends over the ventricular wall surfaces. The profiles of the electrical activation patterns recorded on the right and left flanks of the septum were also asymmetrical, mirroring the architecture of the branches. EGFP made it easy to identify the Purkinje cells in populations of dissociated cardiomyocytes and they were investigated using the patch-clamp technique. The hyperpolarization-activated current (I f) was recorded in all spontaneously active Purkinje cells. Conclusions: This investigation provides positive evidence of the asymmetry of the His-Purkinje system of the adult mouse, and the first patch-clamp recording data on murine cardiac Purkinje cells. This mouse model opens up new perspectives for investigating the contribution of specific genes to the morphology and function of the His-Purkinje system. {\textcopyright} 2004 European Society of Cardiology.

abstract = {The role of local accumulation and diffusion of CO2 to modify cellular loss and extracellular accumulation of K+ during the initial, reversible phase of myocardial ischemia was investigated in isolated, cylindrical papillary muscles of the rabbit. The muscles were blood-perfused through their vascular tree and placed in a (permanently flowing) humidified gas mixture with predetermined partial pressures of N2, O2, and CO2. Ischemia was produced by total arrest of perfusion and O2 withdrawal from the gas mixture. With surface PCO2 kept constant during ischemia, [K+]o varied markedly with muscle geometry. After 10 minutes of ischemia, K+ accumulation was approximately 2.5 mM in muscles with a radius of 0.35 mm and approximately 14 mM in muscles with a radius of 0.9 mm, indicating that a large fraction of K+ accumulation was dependent on diffusion of a volatile metabolite. Computer simulation of CO2 accumulation and diffusion within a tissue cylinder suggested a close phenomenological relation between PCO2 and [K+]o in ischemia. This was confirmed by the finding that an increase of tissue PCO2 in small cylinders before or during ischemia by externally applied CO2 produced an increase in K+ accumulation. The importance of CO2 diffusion for local inhomogeneities in K+ within the same preparation was demonstrated by showing [K+]o gradients with simultaneous or consecutive measurements between the papillary muscle cylinders and the adjacent septum and within 300 microns from the surface of the papillary muscle cylinders. These gradients predict an inhomogeneity of impulse conduction that might contribute to the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias. Besides the demonstration that accumulation and diffusion introduce inhomogeneities of [K+]o in ischemia, our results suggest that a significant component of cellular ischemic K+ loss is associated with production and extrusion of metabolic acid. On the basis of previous measurements of pHo and pHi in identical conditions, possible mechanisms of ischemic cellular K+ loss are discussed.},

@article{Hayashi2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Other than bundle branch reentry and interfascicular reentry, monomorphic postmyocardial infarction (post-MI) reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) including the His-Purkinje system has not been reported. Verapamil-sensitive idiopathic left VT includes the left posterior Purkinje fibers but develops in patients without structural heart disease.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe a novel mechanism of reentrant VT arising from the left posterior Purkinje fibers in patients with a prior MI.

METHODS: The study consisted of four patients with a prior MI and symptomatic heart failure who underwent electrophysiologic study and catheter ablation for VT showing right bundle branch block (n = 3) or atypical left bundle branch block (n = 1) morphology with superior axis. In two patients, the VT frequently emerged during the acute phase of MI and required emergency catheter ablation.

RESULTS: Clinical VT was reproducibly induced by programmed stimulation. In three patients, both diastolic and presystolic Purkinje potentials were sequentially recorded along the left ventricular posterior septum during the VT, whereas in the fourth patient, only presystolic Purkinje potentials were observed. During entrainment pacing from the right atrium, diastolic Purkinje potentials were captured orthodromically and demonstrated decremental conduction properties, whereas presystolic Purkinje potentials were captured antidromically and appeared between the His and QRS complex. Radiofrequency energy delivered at the site exhibiting a Purkinje-QRS interval of 58 +/- 26 ms successfully eliminated the VTs without provoking any conduction disturbances.

CONCLUSION: Reentrant monomorphic VT originating from the left posterior Purkinje fibers, which is analogous to idiopathic left VT, can develop in the acute or chronic phase of MI. Catheter ablation is highly effective in eliminating this VT without affecting left ventricular conduction.},

abstract = {Summary: Epicardial and endocardial electrograms, myocardial metabolism, left ventricular pressure, and regional myocardial tension were studied during 15 min coronary occlusions followed by 45 min reperfusion in the in situ pig heart to evaluate their reproducibility and the possibility of a cumulative effect. Two coronary occlusions were performed in 27 animals, three in 21, and four in nine. Throughout the different occlusions there was a progressive increase in peak TQ-ST segment shift, a progressively higher incidence of ST segment alternans, and an increasing prolongation of the ventricular activation time. Regional myocardial tension in the ischaemic area, measured in eight pigs, declined progressively after each occlusion-reperfusion cycle, whereas it failed to change in four sham experiments. Nevertheless, complete electrical recovery ensued after each reperfusion and was progressively quicker throughout the four reperfusions. In addition, lactate production due to ischaemia returned to extraction after each reperfusion when studied in eight pigs undergoing three occlusion-reperfusion cycles.It is concluded that multiple coronary occlusions in pigs causes (a) a progressive deterioration in contractility and (b) a progressive but reversible deterioration in the electrical changes. These findings may explain the impaired segmental wall motion seen in some patients with recurrent angina at rest and no evidence of infarction. In this model, however, the electrical and metabolic recovery after each reperfusion probably indicates that the gross ischaemic alterations were reversed but that a minor though probably increasing degree of tissue necrosis may have been present.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Significant gender differences have been found in performance of the exercise ECG for the identification of coronary artery disease. However, identical exercise ECG ST segment criteria have been used in men and women, which might contribute to the lower accuracy of these methods in women than in men. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the effect of gender-specific test partitions on relative performance of standard and heart rate-adjusted ST segment depression criteria in men and women, the exercise ECGs of 143 women and 477 men were examined. Non-gender-specific test partitions, selected to have matched specificities of 96{\%} for each test method, were determined in all 283 normal subjects, and gender-specific test partitions with identical specificity were determined separately in the 52 normal women and 231 normal men; sensitivity of these criteria was then examined in the 91 women and 246 men with coronary disease. Standard ST segment depression criteria (0.1 mV of additional horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression at end exercise) with identical 96{\%} specificity in the entire group of normal subjects and separately in women and men had a significantly lower sensitivity of 51{\%} in women compared with 67{\%} in men (P {\textless} .01). Among women, performance of the ST segment/heart rate (ST/HR) slope was more improved than that of the ST/HR index by the use of gender-specific criteria. Compared with the performance of non-gender-specific criteria, application of gender-specific ST/HR slope partitions with matched specificity of 96{\%} resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity in women from 84{\%} to 91{\%} (P {\textless} .01), with no significant change in sensitivity in men (89{\%} to 88{\%}) and with no residual difference in sensitivity between men and women. Although the use of gender-specific ST/HR slope criteria significantly improved sensitivity in both men and women with respect to standard criteria (each P {\textless} .0001), the relative increase in sensitivity provided by heart rate adjustment was significantly greater in women than in men (40{\%} versus 21{\%}, P {\textless} .001). Similar gender differences in improvement in performance using gender-specific criteria for the ST/HR slope were observed when analysis of test performance was restricted to the detection of three-vessel coronary disease (50{\%} versus 9{\%}, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: At high specificity, gender-specific test partitions improve sensitivity of the ST/HR slope for the identification of coronary disease in women, with no decrease in sensitivity in men. In contrast, gender-specific partitions do not change performance of standard test criteria, which is lower in women than in men. Accordingly, the relative benefit of heart rate adjustment by the ST/HR slope method is greater in women than in men. These findings support use of the ST/HR slope with use of gender-specific partitions for the identification and quantification of coronary artery disease in both men and women.},

abstract = {Patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography often take $\beta$ antagonists which limit heart rate response and sensitivity in the test for detection of coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the addition of atropine to dobutamine stress echocardiography on clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic outcomes. Dobutamine stress echocardiography was performed starting at and increasing every 3 minutes with 10 $\mu$g/kg/min to a maximum of 40 $\mu$g/kg/min (stage 4), which was continued for 6 minutes. In patients not achieving 85{\%} predicted maximal exercise heart rate and in whom the test was not judged positive on echocardiographic or electrocardiographic criteria, atropine (0.25 mg intravenously, repeated up to a maximum of 1 mg if necessary) was added and dobutamine continued for up to a further 5 minutes, or until an adequate heart rate was achieved or the test was stopped because of chest pain or electrocardiographic changes. Of 80 consecutive patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography within 2 weeks of coronary angiography, 49 required atropine (group A) and 31 required only dobutamine (group B). After dobutamine alone, heart rate (mean ± SD) was higher in group B than in group A: 129 ± 20 vs 90 ± 18 beats/min, p {\textless} 0.0001; but after the addition of atropine, heart rate in group A increased to 120 ± 20 beats/min. Overall sensitivity for the detection of coronary disease was 70{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 55 to 83{\%}; after the addition of atropine, sensitivity for group A was 65{\%}, 95{\%} CI 45 to 81{\%}; in group B, sensitivity was 81{\%}, 95{\%} CI 54 to 96{\%}. Overall specificity for the detection of coronary disease was 88{\%}, 95{\%} CI 72 to 97{\%}; specificity was 89{\%}, 95{\%} CI 65 to 99{\%} after atropine in group A and 87{\%}, 95{\%} CI 60 to 98{\%} in group B. The addition of atropine did not reduce specificity of the test. There were no severe complications and no difference between groups in the frequency of complications or the need to administer $\beta$ blockers for relief of symptoms. The addition of atropine to dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients whose test results are negative and who do not achieve 85{\%} predicted maximal heart rate during dobutamine alone increases the sensitivity of the test for detection of coronary artery disease without loss of specificity and without severe adverse effects.},

abstract = {We quantify and provide biophysical explanations for some aspects of the relationship between the bidomain conductivities and ST-segment epicardial potentials that result from subendocardial ischemia. We performed computer simulations of ischemia with a realistic whole heart model. The model included a patch of subendocardial ischemic tissue of variable transmural thickness with reduced action potential amplitude. We also varied both intracellular and extracellular conductivities of the heart and the conductivity of ventricular blood in the simulations. At medium or high thicknesses of transmural ischemia (i.e., at least 40{\%} thickness through the heart wall), a consistent pattern of two minima of the epicardial potential over opposite sides of the boundary between healthy and ischemic tissue appeared on the epicardium over a wide range of conductivity values. The magnitude of the net epicardial potential difference, the epicardial maximum minus the epicardial minimum, was strongly correlated to the intracellular to extracellular conductivity ratios both along and across fibers. Anisotropy of the ischemic source region was critical in predicting epicardial potentials, whereas anisotropy of the heart away from the ischemic region had a less significant impact on epicardial potentials. Subendocardial ischemia that extends through at least 40{\%} of the heart wall is manifest on the epicardium by at least one area of ST-segment depression located over a boundary between ischemic and healthy tissue. The magnitude of the depression is a function of the bidomain conductivity values.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that cardiac micro-ribonucleic acid (miR) profiling in severe heart failure patients at the time of ventricular assist device (VAD) placement would differentiate those who remained VAD-dependent from those with subsequent left ventricular (LV) recovery. Background: The relationship of myocardial miR expression to ventricular recovery is unknown. Methods: We studied 28 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy requiring VAD support consisting of test and validation cohorts from 2 institutions: 14 with subsequent LV recovery and VAD removal and 14 clinically matched VAD-dependent patients. Apical core myocardium was studied for expression of 376 miRs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array and real-time-PCR methods. Samples from 7 nonfailing hearts were used in confirmatory studies. Results: By PCR array, 10 miRs were differentially expressed between LV recovery and VAD-dependent patients in the test cohort. The real-time PCR confirmed lower expression in LV recovery patients for 4 miRs (15b, -1.5-fold; 23a, -2.2-fold; 26a, -1.4-fold; and 195, -1.8-fold; all p {\textless} 0.04 vs. VAD dependent). The validation cohort similarly showed lower miRs expression in LV recovery patients (23a, -1.8-fold; and 195, -1.5-fold; both p {\textless} 0.03). Furthermore, miR 23a and 195 expression in nonfailing hearts was similar to LV recovery patients (both p {\textless} 0.04 vs. VAD dependent). The LV recovery patients also had significantly smaller cardiomyocytes by quantitative histology in both cohorts. Conclusions: Lower cardiac expression of miRs 23a and 195 and smaller cardiomyocyte size at the time of VAD placement were associated with subsequent LV functional recovery. Differential expression of miRs at VAD placement may provide markers to assess recovery potential. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

The contribution of the concentrating effect due to shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) to cellular K+ efflux on extracellular potassium ([K+]o) accumulation in response to ischaemia was investigated in an isolated, blood-perfused rabbit papillary muscle preparation with a confined extracellular space. 2. The ECS was quantified using either of two extracellular markers, choline or tetramethyl ammonium (TMA), each with specific ion-selective electrodes, as well as by measurement of extracellular resistance (ro). [K+]o and [Na+]o were also measured simultaneously using K(+)- and Na(+)-selective electrodes. 3. During ischaemia, [K+]o increased 3-fold from 4.2 +/- 0.1 to 12.6 +/- 1.0 mM at 10 min (n = 10) analogous to changes in the ischaemic heart in vivo. The ECS decreased to 83.9 +/- 3.2{\%} of control measured using 1 mM choline extracellularly (n = 9, P {\textless} 0.01) or to 85.7 +/- 0.7{\%} of control using 1 mM TMA (n = 6, P {\textless} 0.01). Nearly identical decreases in ro (84.1 +/- 2.4{\%}, n = 15, P {\textless} 0.01) occurred simultaneously. 4. The small decrease in the ECS contributed only 0.8-0.9 mM to the total increase in [K+]o of 8.4 mM and had a minor effect on transmembrane K+ flux. No significant differences between the relative changes in [choline] and [Na+]o were observed. This excluded a major transmembrane Na+ movement during early ischaemia. 5. Bumetanide (10 mM), an inhibitor of K(+)-Cl- cotransport, a process which is involved in cell volume regulation consequent to osmotic cell swelling, significantly attenuated the increase in [K+]o after 6 min of ischaemia (8.3 +/- 0.6 mM, n = 5 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.4 mM in the control group, n = 6, P {\textless} 0.05), whereas N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM), a stimulator of this cotransporter, augmented [K+]o accumulation (12.0 +/- 0.6 mM at 6 min, P {\textless} 0.05). 6. We conclude that during early myocardial ischaemia, a major component of [K+]o accumulation is not caused by diminution of ECS per se, but rather by increased net K+ efflux due in part to K(+)-Cl cotransport secondary to myocyte volume regulation.},

abstract = {Ventricular tachycardia, a life-threatening regular and repetitive fast heart rhythm, frequently occurs in the setting of myocardial infarction. Recently, the peri-infarct zones surrounding the necrotic scar (termed gray zones) have been shown to correlate with ventricular tachycardia inducibility. However, it remains unknown how the latter is determined by gray zone distribution and size. The goal of this study is to examine how tachycardia circuits are maintained in the infarcted heart and to explore the relationship between the tachycardia organizing centers and the infarct gray zone size and degree of heterogeneity. To achieve the goals of the study, we employ a sophisticated high-resolution electrophysiological model of the infarcted canine ventricles reconstructed from imaging data, representing both scar and gray zone. The baseline canine ventricular model was also used to generate additional ventricular models with different gray zone sizes, as well as models in which the gray zone was represented as different heterogeneous combinations of viable tissue and necrotic scar. The results of the tachycardia induction simulations with a number of high-resolution canine ventricular models (22 altogether) demonstrated that the gray zone was the critical factor resulting in arrhythmia induction and maintenance. In all models with inducible arrhythmia, the scroll-wave filaments were contained entirely within the gray zone, regardless of its size or the level of heterogeneity of its composition. The gray zone was thus found to be the arrhythmogenic substrate that promoted wavebreak and reentry formation. We found that the scroll-wave filament locations were insensitive to the structural composition of the gray zone and were determined predominantly by the gray zone morphology and size. The findings of this study have important implications for the advancement of improved criteria for stratifying arrhythmia risk in post-infarction patients and for the development of new approaches for determining the ablation targets of infarct-related tachycardia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients' perceptions of the quality of their hospitalization have become important to the American healthcare system. Standard surveys of perceived quality of healthcare do not focus on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) portion of the stay. Our objective was to evaluate the construct validity and internal consistency of the Intermountain Patient Perception of Quality (PPQ) survey among patients discharged from the ICU.

METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected results from the ICU PPQ survey of all inpatients at Intermountain Medical Center whose hospitalization included an ICU stay. We employed principal components analysis to determine the constructs present in the PPQ survey, and Cronbach's alpha to evaluate the internal consistency (reliability) of the items representing each construct.

RESULTS: We identified 5,680 patients who had completed the PPQ survey. There were three basic domains measured: nursing care, physician care, and overall perception of quality. Most of the variability was explained with the first two principal components. Constructs did not vary by type of respondent.

CONCLUSIONS: The Intermountain ICU PPQ survey demonstrated excellent construct validity across three distinct constructs. This, in addition to its previously established content validity, suggests the utility of the PPQ survey as an assay of the perceived quality of the ICU experience.},

abstract = {Objective: Drainage of blood from the mediastinum and pleura following open cardiac procedures is usually carried out using one or more large-bore plastic chest tubes. Recently small diameter siliastic drains have been reported to evacuate blood with a better patient comfort. The efficacy and safety of different chest tubes have not yet been fully evaluated. Methods: One hundred fifty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were randomised to have either Blake{\textregistered} 24F (Ethicon, Inc, Somerville, NJ), Argyle{\textregistered} 32F plastic (Tyco Healthcare, Tullamore, UK) or Jostra{\textregistered} 32F silastic (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) drains inserted for evacuation of postoperative bleeding. Bleeding rate per hour, total blood loss, patient discomfort during drain removal, residual pleural fluid at chest X-ray 3 days and 3 weeks after the operation were recorded. Results: Bleeding pattern and total bleeding did not differ significantly in the three groups. Median blood loss was 615 ml (quartile range 390-820 ml) in the Blake-group, 750 ml (quartile range 430-870 ml) in the Jostra-group and 580 ml (quartile range 450-750 ml) in the Argyle-group, respectively (p = 0.17). Pain at removal the day after the operation was similar in the three groups. Residual fluid in the left pleura did not differ significantly at 3 days (p = 0.41) or at 3 weeks postoperatively (p = 0.42). Conclusions: None of the three chest tubes was superior to drain postoperative bleeding or considering pain at removal. Local clinical routines and cost aspects should be the guide in choosing drainage system for open cardiac operations. {\textcopyright} 2007 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.},

abstract = {Introduction. The genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) and success of AF ablation therapy have been strongly linked with atrial fibrosis. Increasing evidence suggests that patient-specific distributions of fibrosis may determine the locations of electrical drivers (rotors) sustaining AF, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. This study aims to elucidate a missing mechanistic link between patient-specific fibrosis distributions and AF drivers. Methods. 3D atrial models integrated human atrial geometry, rule-based fibre orientation, region-specific electrophysiology and AF-induced ionic remodelling. A novel detailed model for an atrial fibroblast was developed, and effects of myocyte-fibroblast (M-F) coupling were explored at single-cell, 1D tissue and 3D atria levels. Left atrial LGE MRI datasets from 3 chronic AF patients were segmented to provide the patient-specific distributions of fibrosis. The data was non-linearly registered and mapped to the 3D atria model. Six distinctive fibrosis levels (0 – healthy tissue, 5 – dense fibrosis) were identified based on LGE MRI intensity and modelled as progressively increasing M-F coupling and decreasing atrial tissue coupling. Uniform 3D atrial model with diffuse (level 2) fibrosis was considered for comparison. Results. In single cells and tissue, the largest effect of atrial M-F coupling was on the myocyte resting membrane potential, leading to partial inactivation of sodium current and reduction of conduction velocity (CV). In the 3D atria, further to the M-F coupling, effects of fibrosis on tissue coupling greatly reduce atrial CV. AF was initiated by fast pacing in each 3D model with either uniform or patient-specific fibrosis. High variation in fibrosis distributions between the models resulted in varying complexity of AF, with several drivers emerging. In the diffuse fibrosis models, waves randomly meandered through the atria, whereas in each the patient-specific models, rotors stabilised in fibrotic regions. The rotors propagated slowly around the border zones of patchy fibrosis (levels 3-4), failing to spread into inner areas of dense fibrosis. Conclusion. Rotors stabilise in the border zones of patchy fibrosis in 3D atria, where slow conduction enable the development of circuits within relatively small regions. Our results can provide a mechanistic explanation for the clinical efficacy of ablation around fibrotic regions.},

abstract = {Myocardial ischemia is the response of the heart to reduced coronary blood flow, leading to changes in ST segment potentials. ST segment depression is regarded as an indicator of nontransmural myocardial ischemia; however, not all nontransmural ischemia results in ST depression. This apparent discrepancy may be the result of many complex factors in cardiac response mechanisms to reduced blood flow. As a result, sophisticated computer models have emerged that have provided key insights into this complex phenomenon and the circumstances surrounding ST depression. Though these models have been able to produce ST depressions, many have neglected the effect of intracavitary blood volume, associated with different phases of the cardiac cycle. To explore the influence of the cardiac blood volume variability on epicardial potentials during nontransmural ischemia, we incorporated a thin, subendocardial ischemic zone geometry into an anatomically realistic, image-based ventricular model, and generated a finite element, static bidomain solution to determine the resulting epicardial surface potentials. It was first determined that, under baseline conditions (i.e., expanded left ventricular volumes corresponding to diastole), a predictable ST depression developed over the ischemic region. Left ventricular volume was then incrementally reduced, while maintaining the size and general shape of the ischemic region, in order to reflect the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle. As blood volume geometries decreased, epicardial ST depression overlying the ischemic region first increased in surface area as blood volume was reduced and before dramatically reducing near 30{\%} blood volume reduction - accentuating the role and importance of blood volume variation in computational models of ischemia.},

abstract = {To determine whether cardiac failure produced by chronic coronary artery stenosis was associated with the activation of myocyte cellular hyperplasia in the myocardium, the changes in number and size of left ventricular myocytes were measured in rats 3 months after surgery. The hypertrophied left ventricle was found to possess 44{\%}, 32{\%}, 49{\%}, and 48{\%} fewer mononucleated, binucleated, trinucleated, and tetranucleated myocytes, respectively. In contrast, the hypertrophied right ventricle contained 1.49 x 10(6) more myocytes as a result of a 2.1-fold, 1.4-fold, and 1.4-fold increase in mononucleated, binucleated, and tetranucleated myocytes. Myocyte cell volume was seen to increase 49{\%} and 21{\%} in left and right ventricular myocytes, respectively. The process of myocyte cellular hyperplasia in the right ventricular myocardium was accompanied by capillary proliferation, and these events were responsible for the parallel addition of newly formed cells and capillaries within the wall and mural thickening. Moreover, the in-series insertion of new myocytes contributed to right ventricular dilatation after coronary artery stenosis. In view of the fact that extensive myocardial damage and cell loss may have masked the phenomenon of myocyte cellular hyperplasia in the left ventricle, the presence of DNA synthesis in myocyte nuclei was evaluated at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months after coronary artery stenosis. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling markedly increased in myocyte nuclei of both ventricles, reaching its peak at 1 and 2 weeks. BrdU labeling of nonmyocyte nuclei also increased but mostly at 2 weeks.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To realize objective atrial scar assessment, this study aimed to develop a fully automatic method to segment the left atrium (LA) and pulmonary veins (PV) from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The extent and distribution of atrial scar, visualized by LGE-MRI, provides important information for clinical treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six AF patients (age 62 ± 8, 14 female) who underwent cardiac MRI prior to RF ablation were included. A contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) sequence was acquired for anatomy assessment followed by an LGE sequence for LA scar assessment. A fully automatic segmentation method was proposed consisting of two stages: 1) global segmentation by multiatlas registration; and 2) local refinement by 3D level-set. These automatic segmentation results were compared with manual segmentation.

RESULTS: The LA and PVs were automatically segmented in all subjects. Compared with manual segmentation, the method yielded a surface-to-surface distance of 1.49 ± 0.65 mm in the LA region when using both MRA and LGE, and 1.80 ± 0.93 mm when using LGE alone (P {\textless} 0.05). In the PV regions, the distance was 2.13 ± 0.67 mm and 2.46 ± 1.81 mm (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively. The difference between automatic and manual segmentation was comparable to the interobserver difference (P = 0.8 in LA region and P = 0.7 in PV region).

CONCLUSION: We developed a fully automatic method for LA and PV segmentation from LGE-MRI, with comparable performance to a human observer. Inclusion of an MRA sequence further improves the segmentation accuracy. The method leads to automatic generation of a patient-specific model, and potentially enables objective atrial scar assessment for AF patients. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between T wave normalization during dobutamine stress testing and stress-induced ischaemia evaluated by echocardiography and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients with previous non-Q wave myocardial infarction. Among 520 patients who underwent dobutamine stress, testing in conjunction with simultaneous echocardiography and 201 thallium or sestamibi SPECT for evaluation of suspected myocardial ischaemia, 36 were selected according to the following criteria: previous non-Q wave myocardial infarction, normal QRS, negative T waves in two or more ECG leads and no significant ST segment depression or elevation at rest or during stress. Diagnosis of ischaemia relied upon the occurrence of reversible perfusion defects by scintigraphy and stress-induced wall motion abnormalities by echocardiography. During the test, T wave normalization (defined as a resting negative T wave becoming upright in one or more ECG leads during stress) occurred in 20 patients (group 1), while in 16 patients the T waves remained negative (group 2). The prevalence of ischaemia was higher in group 1 than in group 2 both by scintigraphy (85{\%} vs 38{\%}, P = 0.004) and by echocardiography (70{\%} vs 32{\%}, P = 0.02). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of T wave normalization in the detection of ischaemia were 74{\%}, 77{\%} and 75{\%} by SPECT and 74{\%}, 65{\%} and 69{\%} by echocardiography respectively. CONCLUSION In patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction and suspected myocardial ischaemia, T wave normalization without concomitant ECG changes during dobutamine stress testing is associated with a higher prevalence of ischaemia compared to patients with persistent T wave inversion. This ECG finding should not be disregarded as a marker of ischaemia in that particular patient population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at evaluating the effects of phenylephrine infusion on the occurrence of focal atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal AF can be initiated by ectopic atrial beats originating in the pulmonary vein (PV) or superior vena cava (SVC). The effect of change in autonomic tone on this focal AF is unknown. METHODS: This study included 12 patients with frequent bursts of AF documented by 24-h Holter monitoring. The number and coupling interval of spontaneous ectopic activity and bursts of AF were evaluated for 1 min before and after phenylephrine (2 to 3 $\mu$g/kg) injection. RESULTS: After detailed mapping, four patients had a focus located in the left superior PV, six in the right superior PV and two in the SVC. In 10 patients with AF foci originating in the PVs, the frequency of ectopic activity (19.5 ± 27.4 vs. 11.4 ± 22.9 beats/min, p = 0.059) was reduced as well as AF bursts (14 ± 3 vs. 1.8 ± 2.7 bursts/min, p = 0.005) before versus after phenylephrine injection; the minimal coupling interval of ectopic activity and AF bursts became longer compared with baseline. The maximal percent increase in sinus cycle length after phenylephrine injection was significantly greater in patients with complete suppression of AF compared with those with partial suppression (43 ± 19 vs. 14 ± 5{\%}, p = 0.01). However, no significant effect of phenylephrine on AF originating in the SVC was found. CONCLUSIONS: Change in autonomic tone induced by phenylephrine injection was effective in suppressing focal AF originating in the PVs but not in the SVC.

These small non-coding RNAs bind to target sequences in mRNAs, typically resulting in repressed gene expression. Several methods are now available for identifying miRNA target sites, but the mere presence of an miRNA-binding site is insufficient for predicting target regulation. Regulation of targets by miRNAs is subject to various levels of control, and recent developments have presented a new twist; targets can reciprocally control the level and function of miRNAs. This mutual regulation of miRNAs and target genes is challenging our understanding of the gene-regulatory role of miRNAs in vivo and has important implications for the use of these RNAs in therapeutic settings.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.Background - Variability in premature ventricular contraction (PVC) coupling interval (CI) increases the risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. The autonomic nervous system regulates cardiac electrical and mechanical indices, and its dysregulation plays an important role in cardiac disease pathogenesis. The impact of PVCs on the intrinsic cardiac nervous system, a neural network on the heart, remains unknown. The objective was to determine the effect of PVCs and CI on intrinsic cardiac nervous system function in generating cardiac neuronal and electric instability using a novel cardioneural mapping approach. Methods and Results - In a porcine model (n=8), neuronal activity was recorded from a ventricular ganglion using a microelectrode array, and cardiac electrophysiological mapping was performed. Neurons were functionally classified based on their response to afferent and efferent cardiovascular stimuli, with neurons that responded to both defined as convergent (local reflex processors). Dynamic changes in neuronal activity were then evaluated in response to right ventricular outflow tract PVCs with fixed short, fixed long, and variable CI. PVC delivery elicited a greater neuronal response than all other stimuli (P{\textless}0.001). Compared with fixed short and long CI, PVCs with variable CI had a greater impact on neuronal response (P{\textless}0.05 versus short CI), particularly on convergent neurons (P{\textless}0.05), as well as neurons receiving sympathetic (P{\textless}0.05) and parasympathetic input (P{\textless}0.05). The greatest cardiac electric instability was also observed after variable (short) CI PVCs. Conclusions - Variable CI PVCs affect critical populations of intrinsic cardiac nervous system neurons and alter cardiac repolarization. These changes may be critical for arrhythmogenesis and remodeling, leading to cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the reproducibility of 7 late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) quantification techniques across 3 conditions in which LGE is known to be important: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), chronic myocardial infarction (CMI), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Background LGE by cardiac magnetic resonance is the gold-standard technique for assessing myocardial scar. No consensus exists on the best method for its quantification, and research in this area is scant. Techniques include manual quantification, thresholding by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 SDs above remote myocardium, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) technique. To date, LGE has been linked to outcome in 3 conditions: AMI, CMI, and HCM. Methods Sixty patients with 3 LGE etiologies (AMI, n = 20; CMI, n = 20; HCM, n = 20) were scanned for LGE. LGE volume was quantified using the 7 techniques. Mean LGE volume, interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility, and impact on sample size were assessed. Results LGE volume varied significantly with the quantification method used. There was no statistically significant difference between LGE volume by the FWHM, manual, and 6-SD or 5-SD techniques. The 2-SD technique generated LGE volumes up to 2 times higher than the FWHM, 6-SD, and manual techniques. The reproducibility of all techniques was worse in HCM than AMI or CMI. The FWHM technique was the most reproducible in all 3 conditions compared with any other method (p {\textless} 0.001). Use of the FWHM technique for LGE quantification in paired analysis would lead to at least a 60{\%} reduction in required sample size compared with any other method. Conclusions Regardless of the disease under study, the FWHM technique for LGE quantification gives LGE volume mean results similar to manual quantification and is statistically the most reproducible, reducing required sample sizes by up to one-half. {\textcopyright} 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {The ability to silence, in a temporally precise fashion, the electrical activity of specific neurons embedded within intact brain tissue, is important for understanding the role that those neurons play in behaviors, brain disorders, and neural computations. "Optogenetic" silencers, genetically encoded molecules that, when expressed in targeted cells within neural networks, enable their electrical activity to be quieted in response to pulses of light, are enabling these kinds of causal circuit analyses studies. Two major classes of optogenetic silencer are in broad use in species ranging from worm to monkey: light-driven inward chloride pumps, or halorhodopsins, and light-driven outward proton pumps, such as archaerhodopsins and fungal light-driven proton pumps. Both classes of molecule, when expressed in neurons via viral or other transgenic means, enable the targeted neurons to be hyperpolarized by light. We here review the current status of these sets of molecules, and discuss how they are being discovered and engineered. We also discuss their expression properties, ionic properties, spectral characteristics, and kinetics. Such tools may not only find many uses in the quieting of electrical activity for basic science studies but may also, in the future, find clinical uses for their ability to safely and transiently shut down cellular electrical activity in a precise fashion.},

We show that mice lacking either miR-133a-1 or miR-133a-2 are normal, whereas deletion of both miRNAs causes lethal ventricular-septal defects in approximately half of double-mutant embryos or neonates; miR-133a double-mutant mice that survive to adulthood succumb to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The absence of miR-133a expression results in ectopic expression of smooth muscle genes in the heart and aberrant cardiomyocyte proliferation. These abnormalities can be attributed, at least in part, to elevated expression of SRF and cyclin D2, which are targets for repression by miR-133a. These findings reveal essential and redundant roles for miR-133a-1 and miR-133a-2 in orchestrating cardiac development, gene expression, and function and point to these miRNAs as critical components of an SRF-dependent myogenic transcriptional circuit.},

abstract = {Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy is the gold standard in interventional treatment of many cardiac arrhythmias. A major obstacle are non transmural lesions, leading to recurrence of arrhythmias. Recent clinical studies have suggested intracardiac electrogram (EGM) criteria as a promising marker to evaluate lesion development. Seeking for a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms, we established a simulation approach for acute RFA lesions. Ablation lesions were modeled by a passive necrotic core surrounded by a borderzone with properties of heated myocardium. Herein, conduction velocity and electrophysiological properties were altered. We simulated EGMs during RFA to study the relation between lesion formation and EGM changes using the bidomain model. Simulations were performed on a three dimensional setup including a geometrically detailed representation of the catheter with highly conductive electrodes. For validation, EGMs recorded during RFA procedures in five patients were analyzed and compared to simulation results. Clinical data showed major changes in the distal unipolar EGM. During RFA, the negative peak amplitude decreased up to 104{\%} and maximum negative deflection was up to 88{\%} smaller at the end of the ablation sequence. These changes mainly occurred in the first 10 s after ablation onset. Simulated unipolar EGM reproduced the clinical changes, reaching up to 83{\%} negative peak amplitude reduction and 80{\%} decrease in maximum negative deflection for transmural lesions. In future work, the established model may enable the development of further EGM criteria for transmural lesions even for complex geometries in order to support clinical therapy.},

abstract = {The contractile tissue of the heart is composed of individual cardiomyocytes. During mammalian embryonic development, heart growth is achieved by cell division while at the same time the heart is already exerting its essential pumping activity. There is still some debate whether the proliferative activity is carried out by a less differentiated, stem cell-like type of cardiomyocytes or whether embryonic cardiomyocytes are able to perform both of these completely different dynamic tasks, contraction and cell division. Our analysis of triple-stained specimen of cultured embryonic cardiomyocytes and of whole mount preparations of embryonic mouse hearts by confocal microscopy revealed that differentiated cardiomyocytes are indeed able to proliferate. However, to go through cell division, a disassembly of the contractile elements, the myofibrils, has to take place. This disassembly occurs in two steps with Z-disk and thin (actin)-filament-associated proteins getting disassembled before disassembly of the M-bands and the thick (myosin) filaments happens. After cytokinesis reassembly of the myofibrillar proteins to their mature cross-striated pattern can be seen. Another interesting observation was that the cell-cell contacts remain seemingly intact during division, probably reflecting the requirement of intact integration sites of the individual cells in the contractile tissue. Our results suggest that embryonic cardiomyocytes have developed an interesting strategy to deal with their major cytoskeletal elements, the myofibrils, during mitosis. The complex disassembly-reassembly process might also provide a mechanistic explanation, why cardiomyocytes cede to divide postnatally.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a fast and robust practical tool for segmentation of solid tumors with minimal user interaction to assist clinicians and researchers in radiosurgery planning and assessment of the response to the therapy. Particularly, a cellular automata (CA) based seeded tumor segmentation method on contrast enhanced T1 weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, which standardizes the volume of interest (VOI) and seed selection, is proposed. First, we establish the connection of the CA-based segmentation to the graph-theoretic methods to show that the iterative CA framework solves the shortest path problem. In that regard, we modify the state transition function of the CA to calculate the exact shortest path solution. Furthermore, a sensitivity parameter is introduced to adapt to the heterogeneous tumor segmentation problem, and an implicit level set surface is evolved on a tumor probability map constructed from CA states to impose spatial smoothness. Sufficient information to initialize the algorithm is gathered from the user simply by a line drawn on the maximum diameter of the tumor, in line with the clinical practice. Furthermore, an algorithm based on CA is presented to differentiate necrotic and enhancing tumor tissue content, which gains importance for a detailed assessment of radiation therapy response. Validation studies on both clinical and synthetic brain tumor datasets demonstrate 80{\%}-90{\%} overlap performance of the proposed algorithm with an emphasis on less sensitivity to seed initialization, robustness with respect to different and heterogeneous tumor types, and its efficiency in terms of computation time.},

abstract = {c-kit-positive, lineage-negative cardiac stem cells (CSCs) improve post-infarction left ventricular (LV) dysfunction when administered to animals. We undertook a phase 1 trial (Stem Cell Infusion in Patients with Ischemic cardiOmyopathy [SCIPIO]) of autologous CSCs for the treatment of heart failure resulting from ischaemic heart disease. In stage A of the SCIPIO trial, patients with post-infarction LV dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] ≤40) before coronary artery bypass grafting were consecutively enrolled in the treatment and control groups. In stage B, patients were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group in a 2:3 ratio by use of a computer-generated block randomisation scheme. 1 million autologous CSCs were administered by intracoronary infusion at a mean of 113 days (SE 4) after surgery; controls were not given any treatment. Although the study was open label, the echocardiographic analyses were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was short-term safety of CSCs and the secondary endpoint was efficacy. A per-protocol analysis was used. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00474461. This study is still in progress. 16 patients were assigned to the treatment group and seven to the control group; no CSC-related adverse effects were reported. In 14 CSC-treated patients who were analysed, LVEF increased from 30{\textperiodcentered}3 (SE 1{\textperiodcentered}9) before CSC infusion to 38{\textperiodcentered}5 (2{\textperiodcentered}8) at 4 months after infusion (p=0{\textperiodcentered}001). By contrast, in seven control patients, during the corresponding time interval, LVEF did not change (30{\textperiodcentered}1 [2{\textperiodcentered}4] at 4 months after CABG vs 30{\textperiodcentered}2 [2{\textperiodcentered}5] at 8 months after CABG). Importantly, the salubrious effects of CSCs were even more pronounced at 1 year in eight patients (eg, LVEF increased by 12{\textperiodcentered}3 ejection fraction units [2{\textperiodcentered}1] vs baseline, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0007). In the seven treated patients in whom cardiac MRI could be done, infarct size decreased from 32{\textperiodcentered}6 g (6{\textperiodcentered}3) by 7{\textperiodcentered}8 g (1{\textperiodcentered}7; 24) at 4 months (p=0{\textperiodcentered}004) and 9{\textperiodcentered}8 g (3{\textperiodcentered}5; 30) at 1 year (p=0{\textperiodcentered}04). These initial results in patients are very encouraging. They suggest that intracoronary infusion of autologous CSCs is effective in improving LV systolic function and reducing infarct size in patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction, and warrant further, larger, phase 2 studies.

METHODS Exercise or dobutamine stress tests with perfusion scintigraphy were performed in 1,173 patients with abnormal T-waves on their baseline electrocardiograms. The results of perfusion scintigraphy were compared in patients with and without stress-induced T-wave normalization. RESULTS Only 33 of 270 patients with reversible perfusion defects (12.2{\%}) had T-wave normalization during stress while 76.4{\%} of 140 patients who had T-wave normalization during stress did not have a reversible perfusion defect. Results were similar for patients who did or did not reach 85{\%} of their maximal predicted heart rate, for patients with and without Q-wave infarction on the baseline EKG and for patients who did or did not have ischemic ST-segment depression during stress. CONCLUSIONS T-wave normalization during stress testing has low sensitivity and poor positive predictive value for stress-induced reversible myocardial ischemia.},

@article{Hooks2007,
abstract = {The response of the heart to electrical shock, electrical propagation in sinus rhythm, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of ventricular fibrillation all depend critically on the electrical anisotropy of cardiac tissue. A long-held view of cardiac electrical anisotropy is that electrical conductivity is greatest along the myocyte axis allowing most rapid propagation of electrical activation in this direction, and that conductivity is isotropic transverse to the myocyte axis supporting a slower uniform spread of activation in this plane. In this context, knowledge of conductivity in two directions, parallel and transverse to the myofiber axis, is sufficient to characterize the electrical action of the heart. Here we present new experimental data that challenge this view. We have used a novel combination of intramural electrical mapping, and experiment-specific computer modeling, to demonstrate that left ventricular myocardium has unique bulk conductivities associated with three microstructurally-defined axes. We show that voltage fields induced by intramural current injection are influenced by not only myofiber direction, but also the transmural arrangement of muscle layers or myolaminae. Computer models of these experiments, in which measured 3D tissue structure was reconstructed in-silico, best matched recorded voltages with conductivities in the myofiber direction, and parallel and normal to myolaminae, set in the ratio 4:2:1, respectively. These findings redefine cardiac tissue as an electrically orthotropic substrate and enhance our understanding of how external shocks may act to successfully reset the fibrillating heart into a uniform electrical state. More generally, the mechanisms governing the destabilization of coordinated electrical propagation into ventricular arrhythmia need to be evaluated in the light of this discovery.},

@article{Schotten2011,
abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that can occur as the result of numerous different pathophysiological processes in the atria. Some aspects of the morphological and electrophysiological alterations promoting AF have been studied extensively in animal models. Atrial tachycardia or AF itself shortens atrial refractoriness and causes loss of atrial contractility. Aging, neurohumoral activation, and chronic atrial stretch due to structural heart disease activate a variety of signaling pathways leading to histological changes in the atria including myocyte hypertrophy, fibroblast proliferation, and complex alterations of the extracellular matrix including tissue fibrosis. These changes in electrical, contractile, and structural properties of the atria have been called "atrial remodeling." The resulting electrophysiological substrate is characterized by shortening of atrial refractoriness and reentrant wavelength or by local conduction heterogeneities caused by disruption of electrical interconnections between muscle bundles. Under these conditions, ectopic activity originating from the pulmonary veins or other sites is more likely to occur and to trigger longer episodes of AF. Many of these alterations also occur in patients with or at risk for AF, although the direct demonstration of these mechanisms is sometimes challenging. The diversity of etiological factors and electrophysiological mechanisms promoting AF in humans hampers the development of more effective therapy of AF. This review aims to give a translational overview on the biological basis of atrial remodeling and the proarrhythmic mechanisms involved in the fibrillation process. We pay attention to translation of pathophysiological insights gained from in vitro experiments and animal models to patients. Also, suggestions for future research objectives and therapeutical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {The neonatal mammalian heart is capable of substantial regeneration following injury through cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, this regenerative capacity is lost by postnatal day 7 and the mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest remain unclear. The homeodomain transcription factor Meis1 is required for normal cardiac development but its role in cardiomyocytes is unknown. Here we identify Meis1 as a critical regulator of the cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Meis1 deletion in mouse cardiomyocytes was sufficient for extension of the postnatal proliferative window of cardiomyocytes, and for re-activation of cardiomyocyte mitosis in the adult heart with no deleterious effect on cardiac function. In contrast, overexpression of Meis1 in cardiomyocytes decreased neonatal myocyte proliferation and inhibited neonatal heart regeneration. Finally, we show that Meis1 is required for transcriptional activation of the synergistic CDK inhibitors p15, p16 and p21. These results identify Meis1 as a critical transcriptional regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and a potential therapeutic target for heart regeneration.},

abstract = {Background: Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) reduce scarring after myocardial infarction, increase viable myocardium, and boost cardiac function in preclinical models. We aimed to assess safety of such an approach in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Methods: In the prospective, randomised CArdiosphere-Derived aUtologous stem CElls to reverse ventricUlar dySfunction (CADUCEUS) trial, we enrolled patients 2-4 weeks after myocardial infarction (with left ventricular ejection fraction of 25-45) at two medical centres in the USA. An independent data coordinating centre randomly allocated patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive CDCs or standard care. For patients assigned to receive CDCs, autologous cells grown from endomyocardial biopsy specimens were infused into the infarct-related artery 1{\textperiodcentered}5-3 months after myocardial infarction. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients at 6 months who died due to ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or sudden unexpected death, or had myocardial infarction after cell infusion, new cardiac tumour formation on MRI, or a major adverse cardiac event (MACE; composite of death and hospital admission for heart failure or non-fatal recurrent myocardial infarction). We also assessed preliminary efficacy endpoints on MRI by 6 months. Data analysers were masked to group assignment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00893360. Findings: Between May 5, 2009, and Dec 16, 2010, we randomly allocated 31 eligible participants of whom 25 were included in a per-protocol analysis (17 to CDC group and eight to standard of care). Mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 39 (SD 12) and scar occupied 24 (10) of left ventricular mass. Biopsy samples yielded prescribed cell doses within 36 days (SD 6). No complications were reported within 24 h of CDC infusion. By 6 months, no patients had died, developed cardiac tumours, or MACE in either group. Four patients (24) in the CDC group had serious adverse events compared with one control (13; p=1{\textperiodcentered}00). Compared with controls at 6 months, MRI analysis of patients treated with CDCs showed reductions in scar mass (p=0{\textperiodcentered}001), increases in viable heart mass (p=0{\textperiodcentered}01) and regional contractility (p=0{\textperiodcentered}02), and regional systolic wall thickening (p=0{\textperiodcentered}015). However, changes in end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and LVEF did not differ between groups by 6 months. Interpretation: We show intracoronary infusion of autologous CDCs after myocardial infarction is safe, warranting the expansion of such therapy to phase 2 study. The unprecedented increases we noted in viable myocardium, which are consistent with therapeutic regeneration, merit further assessment of clinical outcomes.

abstract = {Reperfusion-induced lethal ventricular arrhythmias are observed during relief of coronary artery spasm, with unstable angina, exercise-induced ischemia, and silent ischemia. Accordingly, significant efforts are underway to understand the mechanisms responsible for reperfusion-induced lethal arrhythmias and mice have become increasingly important in these efforts. However, although reperfusion-induced sustained ventricular tachycardia leading to ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been recorded in many models, reports in mice are sparse and of limited success. Importantly, none of these studies were conducted in intact, conscious mice. Accordingly, a chronically instrumented, intact, conscious murine model of reperfusion-induced lethal arrhythmias has the potential to be of major importance for advancing the concepts and methods that drive cardiovascular therapies. Therefore, we describe, for the first time, the use of an intact, conscious, murine model of reperfusion-induced lethal arrhythmias. Male mice (n = 9) were instrumented to record cardiac output and the electrocardiogram. In addition, a snare was placed around the left main coronary artery. Following recovery, the susceptibility to sustained ventricular tachycardia produced by 3 min of occlusion and reperfusion of the left main coronary artery was determined in conscious mice by pulling on the snare. Reperfusion culminated in sustained ventricular tachycardia, leading to VF, in all nine conscious mice. The procedures conducted in conscious C57BL/6J mice, a strain commonly used in transgenic studies, can be utilized in genetically modified models to enhance our understanding of single gene defects on reperfusion-induced lethal ventricular arrhythmias in intact, conscious, and complex animals.},

abstract = {Background Previous studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) may identify slowly conducting tissues in scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT). Objective To test the feasibility of image-based simulation based on LGE to estimate ablation targets in VT. Methods We conducted a retrospective study in 13 patients who had preablation magnetic resonance imaging for scar-related VT ablation. We used image-based simulation to induce VT and estimate target regions according to the simulated VT circuit. The estimated target regions were coregistered with the LGE scar map and the ablation sites from the electroanatomical map in the standard ablation approach. Results In image-based simulation, VT was inducible in 12 (92.3{\%}) patients. All VTs showed macroreentrant propagation patterns, and the narrowest width of estimated target region that an ablation line should span to prevent VT recurrence was 5.0 ± 3.4 mm. Of 11 patients who underwent ablation, the results of image-based simulation and the standard approach were consistent in 9 (82{\%}) patients, where ablation within the estimated target region was associated with acute success (n = 8) and ablation outside the estimated target region was associated with failure (n = 1). In 1 (9{\%}) case, the results of image-based simulation and the standard approach were inconsistent, where ablation outside the estimated target region was associated with acute success. Conclusions The image-based simulation can be used to estimate potential ablation targets of scar-related VT. The image-based simulation may be a powerful noninvasive tool for preprocedural planning of ablation procedures to potentially reduce the procedure time and complication rates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Heart Rhythm Society.

abstract = {Aims: To risk stratify and shorten hospital stay in patients with spontaneous (resting) chest pain and a non-diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG). Methods and Results: The study comprised 102 patients (mean age 58 ± 12 years, 67 men) with spontaneous chest pain and a non-diagnostic EGG. Forty-three patients had suspected coronary artery disease and 59 had known (but of unknown actual significance) coronary artery disease. All patients underwent serial creatine kinase enzyme measurements, continuous ECG monitoring for at least 12 h and early dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography in patients with negative creatine kinase enzymes and normal findings at ECG monitoring. Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography was considered positive in patients with new or worsening wall thickening abnormalities. Patients with negative dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography were discharged after the test. In-hospital and 6 month follow-up events noted were cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty. Thirteen patients had evidence of evolving myocardial infarction by elevated creatine kinase enzymes, or unstable angina by ECG monitoring. In the remaining 89 patients, dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography was performed after a median observation period of 31 h (range 12-68 h). During dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography no serious complications (death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) occurred. Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography results were of poor quality in three, non-diagnostic in six, negative in 44 and positive in 36 patients. In the 80 patients with diagnostic dobutamin-atropine stress echocardiography, variables associated with in-hospital events (n = 7) were history of exertional angina (P {\textless} 0.005), chest pain score (P {\textless} 0.005), stress-induced angina (P {\textless} 0.001) and positive dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (P {\textless} 0.005). Variables associated with follow-up events (n = 11) were history of exertional angina (P {\textless} 0.05), chest pain score (P {\textless} 0.001), stress-induced angina (P {\textless} 0.01) and positive dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (P {\textless} 0.01). At multivariate analysis the only significant predictor of events was positive dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography (P {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion: Early dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography may safely distinguish between low- and high-risk subsets for subsequent cardiac events in patients with spontaneous chest pain and a non-diagnostic EGG.

abstract = {Many aspects of ischemia-induced changes in the electrocardiogram lack solid biophysical underpinnings although variations in ST segments form the predominant basis for diagnostic and monitoring of patients. This incomplete knowledge certainly plays a role in the poor performance of some forms of electrocardiogram-based detection and characterization of ischemia, especially when it is limited to the subendocardium. The focus of our recent studies has been to develop a comprehensive mechanistic model of the electrocardiographic effects of ischemia. The computational component of this model is based on highly realistic heart geometry with anisotropic fiber structure and allows us to assign ischemic action potentials to contiguous regions that can span a prescribed thickness of the ventricles. A separate, high-resolution model of myocardial tissue provides us with a means of setting electrical characteristics of the heart, including the status of gap junctional coupling between cells. The experimental counterpart of this model consists of dog hearts, either in situ or isolated and perfused with blood, in which we control coronary blood flow by means of a cannula and blood pump. By reducing blood flow through the cannula for various durations, we can replicate any phase of ischemia from hyper acute to early infarction. Based on the results of these models, there is emerging a mechanism of the electrocardiographic response to ischemia that depends strongly on the anisotropic conductivity of the myocardium. Ischemic injury currents flow across the boundary between healthy and ischemic tissue, but it is their interaction with local fiber orientation and the associated conductivity that generates secondary currents that determine epicardial ST-segment potentials. Results from experiments support qualitatively the findings of the simulations and underscore the role of myocardial anisotropy in electrocardiography. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We studied how attention affects contrast detection performance when the target is surrounded by mask elements. In each display quadrant we presented a hexagon of six vertical Gabor patches (the 'surround'). Only one of the hexagons contained a central Gabor patch (the 'target') and the task was to report that quadrant (spatial four-alternative-forced choice). Attention was manipulated by means of a double-task paradigm: in one condition observers had to perform concurrently a central letter-discrimination task, and the contrast-detection task was then only poorly attended, while attention was fully available in the other condition. We find that under poorly attended conditions targets can be detected only when the target contrast exceeds the surround contrast (contrast popout) or when the target orientation differs from the surround orientation by more than 10-15 degrees (orientation popout). When the target orientation is similar to the surround orientation, attention can reduce the contrast detection thresholds in some cases more than four-fold, demonstrating a very strong attentional effect.},

abstract = {Although a plethora of earlier studies focused on the histology and action potential characteristics of Purkinje fibers, only recently has the His-Purkinje system been found to play a major role in the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias. The anatomic complexity of the left ventricular conduction system appears to favor reentrant arrhythmias in both diseased and healthy hearts. Macroreentrant circuits between the right and left bundles as well as between the left ventricular fascicles are amenable to cure by ablative techniques. Similarly, fascicular tachycardias occurring in individuals without structural cardiac disease appear to involve macroreentrant circuits between fascicles and associated strands (false tendons?). Exciting newer discoveries strongly implicate the Purkinje system as the cause of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with short-coupled premature ventricular complexes and in those with catecholaminergic polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. The role of the His-Purkinje system in the genesis and maintenance of ventricular fibrillation is yet another frontier for fertile investigation. A rich variety of cardiac arrhythmias appears to involve the ventricular specialized conduction system and may be amenable to ablative therapy. ?? 2009 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB), ischemia-induced repolarization changes associated with QTc-interval shortening may be recorded during coronary angioplasty. We aimed to assess whether these repolarization changes may be predictive of severe coronary artery disease in patients with LBBB. METHODS: Fifty noninfarcted LBBB patients underwent dipyridamole stress test and coronary angiography for chest pain. To localize the site of ischemia, we considered four groups of conventional ECG leads (V1-V2-V3; V4-V5-V6; aVL-I; III-aVF-II), exploring the anteroseptal, lateral, high-lateral, and inferior left ventricular walls. ST-T changes and QTc intervals were estimated at rest and peak stress, lead by lead, in each group of leads and the fractional percentage difference between rest-stress QTc intervals ([DELTA]QTc) was calculated. A [DELTA]QTc greater than -10{\%} was used to define significant QTc-interval shortening. Coronary stenosis of more than 70{\%} and more than 90{\%} were considered 'significant' and 'severe'. RESULTS: According to dipyridamole stress test response, two groups were identified: group I (35 patients) with dipyridamole-induced ischemia and group II (15 patients) without dipyridamole-induced ischemia. The wall motion score index at peak stress (compared with resting wall motion score index) was significantly higher in group I (1.98 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.08, P {\textless} 0.0001) than in group II (1.36 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.25 +/- 0.08, P = 0.296). The patients of group I showed a significant QTc-interval shortening ([DELTA]QTc = -16.9 +/- 3.9{\%}), whereas this did not happen in patients of group II ([DELTA]QTc = +8.8 +/- 2.4{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001). The patients of group I also had a more severe stenosis in the vessel related to the stress-induced dyssynergic area (I = 90.5 +/- 9.5 vs. II = 34.3 +/- 31.1{\%}; P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In patients with LBBB, stress-induced pseudonormalization pattern, associated with QTc-interval shortening, allows the identification of cardiac areas supplied by severely stenosed coronary arteries.},

abstract = {Analysis of the rate-related change in exercise-induced ST segment depression using the exercise ST segment/heart rate slope and ST segment/heart rate index can improve the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) for the identification of patients with coronary artery disease, recognition of patients with anatomically or functionally severe coronary obstruction and detection of patients at increased risk for future coronary events. These methods provide a more physiologic approach to analysis of the ST segment response to exercise by adjusting the apparent severity of ischemia for the corresponding increase in myocardial oxygen demand, which in turn can be linearly related to increasing heart rate. Solid-angle theory provides a model for the linear relation of ST segment depression to heart rate during exercise and a framework for understanding the relation of the ST segment/heart rate slope to the presence and extent of coronary artery disease. False positive and false negative test results of the heart rate-adjusted methods are well known in selected populations and require further clarification. Application of these methods is also highly dependent on the type of exercise protocol, number of ECG leads examined, timing of ST segment measurement relative to the J point and accuracy and precision of ST segment measurement. These methodologic details have been an important limitation to test application when traditional protocols and measurement procedures are required. When applied with attention to required details, the heart rate-adjusted methods can improve the usefulness of the exercise ECG in a range of clinically relevant populations. {\textcopyright} 1995 American College of Cardiology.},

abstract = {Background: Discussion about the selection of diagnostic features of the ECG and their possible interpretation would benefit from a model of the genesis of these signals that has a sound basis in electrophysiology as well as in physics. Recent advances in computer technology have made it possible to build a simulation package whereby the genesis of ECG signals can be studied interactively. Design: A numerical method was developed for computing ECG signals on the thorax, as well as electrograms on both endocardium and epicardium. The source representation of the myocardial electric activity is the equivalent double layer. The transfer factors between the electric sources and the resulting potentials on the heart surface as well as on the body surface were computed using a realistic thorax model. Results and conclusion: The resulting transfer factors were implemented in a simulation program. The program allows the user to make interactive changes in the timing of depolarisation and repolarisation on the ventricular surface, as well as changing the local source strength, and to inspect or document the effect of such changes instantaneously on electrograms and body surface potentials, visualised by waveforms as well as by potential maps and movies.

abstract = {Established infections with the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV, respectively) are thought to be permanent with even the most effective immune responses and antiretroviral therapies only able to control, but not clear, these infections. Whether the residual virus that maintains these infections is vulnerable to clearance is a question of central importance to the future management of millions of HIV-infected individuals. We recently reported that approximately 50{\%} of rhesus macaques (RM; Macaca mulatta) vaccinated with SIV protein-expressing rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV/SIV) vectors manifest durable, aviraemic control of infection with the highly pathogenic strain SIVmac239 (ref. 5). Here we show that regardless of the route of challenge, RhCMV/SIV vector-elicited immune responses control SIVmac239 after demonstrable lymphatic and haematogenous viral dissemination, and that replication-competent SIV persists in several sites for weeks to months. Over time, however, protected RM lost signs of SIV infection, showing a consistent lack of measurable plasma- or tissue-associated virus using ultrasensitive assays, and a loss of T-cell reactivity to SIV determinants not in the vaccine. Extensive ultrasensitive quantitative PCR and quantitative PCR with reverse transcription analyses of tissues from RhCMV/SIV vector-protected RM necropsied 69-172 weeks after challenge did not detect SIV RNA or DNA sequences above background levels, and replication-competent SIV was not detected in these RM by extensive co-culture analysis of tissues or by adoptive transfer of 60 million haematolymphoid cells to naive RM. These data provide compelling evidence for progressive clearance of a pathogenic lentiviral infection, and suggest that some lentiviral reservoirs may be susceptible to the continuous effector memory T-cell-mediated immune surveillance elicited and maintained by cytomegalovirus vectors.},

abstract = {1. Ischaemic and hypertrophic heart diseases are associated with ventricular arrhythmias, in which abnormal cellular coupling is implicated as having a causative role. The aim of this series of studies was to characterize gap-junctional organization in normal human ventricular myocardium, and to investigate the hypothesis that alterations in the quantity and patterns of expression of myocardial gap junctions occur in ischaemic and hypertrophic myocardial disease. 2. An antibody raised against connexin43 was used for immunohistochemical labelling of myocardium examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, permitting highly sensitive and quantifiable immunofluorescent imaging of gap junctions through volumes of intact cardiac tissue. 3. Connexin43 gap junctions in normal adult human ventricular myocardium are highly organized into clusters of fluorescent label confined to the intercalated disks as a peripheral ring of larger junctions, with smaller junctions centrally, and occupy a surface area of 0.005 micron2/micron3 myocyte volume. 4. Neonatal human myocardium has a punctate distribution of connexin43 over the entire surface of the ventricular myocytes, with a progressive polarization of the gap junctions towards the positions of the mature intercalated disks, reaching the adult pattern at about 6 years. 5. At the myocardial interface with the scar of a healed infarct, connexin43 gap junction distribution is grossly disturbed, being strewn in longitudinally orientated arrays along the lateral interfaces between degenerated but viable myocytes, which may be due to a redistribution of the pre-existing population of junctions. This altered distribution is present as early as 4 days after coronary occlusion in a canine model, in which it defines the location of circuits causing ventricular tachycardia. 6. Myocardium distant from infarction in patients with ischaemic heart disease has a normal pattern of connexin43 gap junction distribution, but has a 47{\%} reduction in gap junction surface area per unit cell volume, and a 30{\%} reduction per cell. 7. In hypertrophied myocardium from chronically pressure-loaded human left ventricles, connexin43 gap junction expression per myocyte is not significantly different from normal, but is reduced by 40{\%} per unit volume of myocyte. 8. The early phases of the hypertrophic response of myocardium to renovascular hypertension in guinea pigs revealed a substantially increased connexin43 gap junction expression compared with controls, both when measured per cell (increased by 45{\%}) and per unit volume of myocyte (increased by 30{\%}), and therefore showed an alteration apparently contrary to that observed in chronically hypertrophied human ventricular myocardium. 9. In this series of studies, normal adult human ventricular myocardium and the post-natal developmental changes have been characterized with respect to connexin43 gap junction content, and the observed alterations of both distribution and quantity in ischaemic and hypertrophied hearts would be expected to influence myocardial conduction and the arrhythmogenic substrate.},

abstract = {In order to relate the structure of cardiac tissue to its passive electrical conductivity, we created a geometrical model of cardiac tissue on a cellular scale that encompassed myocytes, capillaries, and the interstitial space that surrounds them. A special mesh generator was developed for this model to create realistically shaped myocytes and interstitial space with a controlled degree of variation included in each model. In order to derive the effective conductivities, we used a finite element model to compute the currents flowing through the intracellular and extracellular space due to an externally applied electrical field. The product of these computations were the effective conductivity tensors for the intracellular and extracellular spaces. The simulations of bi-domain conductivities for healthy tissue resulted in an effective intracellular conductivity of 0.16S/m (longitudinal) and 0.005 S/m (transverse) and an effective extracellular conductivity of 0.21S/m (longitudinal) and 0.06 S/m (transverse). The latter values are within the range of measured values reported in literature. Furthermore, we anticipate that this method can be used to simulate pathological conditions for which measured data is far more sparse.},

abstract = {Electrotonic coupling of cardiac myocytes at gap junctions may influence patterns of conduction in myocardium. To delineate the three-dimensional structure and distribution of intercellular junctions, we analyzed serial ultrathin sections of canine myocardium with transmission electron microscopy and disaggregated myocytes with scanning electron microscopy. Morphometric analysis of left ventricular myocardium sectioned in three orthogonal planes revealed that 80{\%} of total gap junctional membrane occurred in large, ribbon-like gap junctions oriented transversely at cell end processes. The remaining 20{\%} of gap junctional membrane was contained in small gap junctions located within plicate segments (interdigitating regions of cell-to-cell adhesion) of intercalated disks. In serial ultrathin sections, all gap junctions were contiguous with plicate segments. Thus, true "lateral" gap junctions do not exist in working ventricular myocytes and would not likely be able to withstand shear forces created by laterally sliding cells. Examination of serial plastic sections with light microscopy revealed complex overlapping of myocytes such that individual myocytes were connected at intercalated disks to an average of 9.1 +/- 2.2 other myocytes. These observations provide an improved understanding of the extent and distribution of cell junctions and should facilitate experimental and model studies of conduction in myocardium.},

abstract = {Although it has been known throughout this century that a complex sequence of electrical events is produced on the body surface by the electrophysiological properties of the heart, the question of how well these body surface events can be explained mathematically on the basis of experimental measurements of cardiac geometry and electrical activity remains unanswered. Recent advances in experimental capabilities have made possible the near simultaneous measurement of both cardiac epicardial and corresponding body surface potential distributions from in vivo animal preparations using chronically implanted electrodes to keep the volume conductor intact. This report provides a method for finding transfer coefficients that relate the epicardial and body surface potential distributions to each other. The method is based on knowing the geometric location of each electrode, and on having enough electrodes to establish the geometric shape and the potential distribution of closed epicardial and body surfaces. However, the method does not require that either the heart or body surfaces have any special shape, such as that of a sphere, or that any electrical uantities, such as voltage gradients, be known in addition to the potentials. The use of potential distributions to represent heart electrical activity is advantageous since such distributions can be directly measured experimentally, without a transformation to any other form, such as multiple current-generating dipoles, being required. This report includes a statement of the underlying integral equations, the procedure. for finding the equations' coefficients from geometry measurements, some considerations for computer algorithms, and an example. The mathematical method also can be used for situations other than relating the epicardial to the body surface, such as considering the potential distributions around small cardiac structures.},

abstract = {Gap junctions play a pivotal role for the velocity and the safety of impulse propagation in cardiac tissue. Under physiologic conditions, the specific subcellular distribution of gap junctions together with the tight packaging of the rod-shaped cardiomyocytes underlies anisotropic conduction, which is continuous at the macroscopic scale. However, when breaking down the three-dimensional network of cells into linear single cell chains, gap junctions can be shown to limit axial current flow and to induce 'saltatory' conduction at unchanged overall conduction velocities. In two- and three-dimensional tissue, these discontinuities disappear due to lateral averaging of depolarizing current flow at the activation wavefront. During gap junctional uncoupling, discontinuities reappear and are accompanied by slowed and meandering conduction. Critical gap junctional uncoupling reduces conduction velocities to a much larger extent than does a reduction of excitability, which suggests that the safety for conduction is higher at any given conduction velocity for gap junctional uncoupling. In uniformly structured tissue, gap junctional uncoupling is accompanied by a parallel decrease in conduction velocity. However, this is not necessarily the case for non-uniform structures like tissue expansion where partial uncoupling paradoxically increases conduction velocity and has the capacity to remove unidirectional conduction blocks. Whereas the impact of gap junctions on impulse conduction is generally assessed from the point of view of cell coupling among cardiomyocytes, it is possible that other cell types within the myocardium might be coupled to cardiomyocytes as well. In this context, it has been shown that fibroblasts establish successful conduction between sheets of cardiomyocytes over distances as long as 300 ??m. This might not only explain electrical synchronization of heart transplants but might be of importance for cardiac diseases involving fibrosis. Finally, the intriguing fact that sodium channels are clustered at the intercalated disc recently rekindled the provocative question of whether gap junctions alone are responsible for impulse propagation or whether electric field mechanisms might account for conduction as well. Whereas computer simulations show the feasibility of conduction in the absence of gap junctional coupling, a definite answer to this question must await further investigations into the biophysical properties of the intercalated disc. ?? 2004 European Society of Cardiology.

abstract = {Guidelines recommend that patients with suggestive symptoms of myocardial ischemia and ST-segment elevation (STE) in ≥2 adjacent electrocardiographic leads should receive immediate reperfusion therapy. Novel strategies aimed to reduce door-to-balloon time, such as prehospital wireless electrocardiographic transmission, may be dependent on the interpretation accuracy of the electrocardiogram (ECG) readers. We assessed the ability of experienced electrocardiographers to differentiate among STE, acute STE myocardial infarction (STEMI), and nonischemic STE (NISTE). A total of 116 consecutive ECGs showing STE were studied. Fifteen experienced cardiologists were asked to decide, based on the ECG and assuming that the patient had compatible symptoms, whether they would send each patient for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). If NISTE was chosen, the reader selected 1 or more 12 possible options to explain the choice. Of 116 patients, only 8 had STEMI. The percentage of ECGs for which PPCI was recommended for the patient by the individual readers varied widely (7.8{\%} to 33{\%}). There was no significant difference between the North American and Other Countries readers (p = 0.13). The sensitivity and specificity of the individual readers ranged from 50{\%} to 100{\%} (average 75{\%}) and 73{\%} to 97{\%} (average 85{\%}), respectively. There were broad inconsistencies among the readers in the chosen reasons used to classify NISTE. In conclusion, we found wide variations among experienced electrocardiographers in reading ECGs with STE and differentiating STEMI with need for PPCI from NISTE. There is a need to revise our current electrocardiographic criteria for differentiating STEMI from NISTE. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The purpose of this manuscript is to review the current literature regarding the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in atrial fibrillation (AF). We will be reviewing its effect on initiation, maintenance, and termination of AF, with emphasis on the role of baroreflex gain (BRG) and autonomic reflexes in the maintenance of this arrhythmia. While it is generally accepted that the ANS plays an important role in AF, the extent of that role remains controversial. Much of the controversy could be explained by the time frame during which the autonomic measurements were made, the differences in patient population, and possibly the differential effect of the autonomic changes on the trigger versus the substrate. While vagal stimulation results in shortening of the atrial effective refractory period and increased dispersion of refractoriness, its effect on the "trigger" might be antiarrhythmic. During AF, cardiac filling pressure increases while arterial blood pressure decreases sending conflicting messages to the medulla. The acute effect is an increase in sympathetic activity to ensure adequate hemodynamic stability. On the other hand, the long-term effects might be impairment in the cardiopulmonary BRG and changes that accentuate the presence of AF. While radiofrequency ablation has provided us with a unique insight into the role of possible denervation in AF suppression, the exact mechanisms involved are far from being completely understood. Today, in an era where great technological advances have occurred, our need to understand the role of the ANS in AF is greater than ever.},

Partitions chosen by the method of percentile estimation to include 95{\%} of normal subjects remained highly specific in subjects with nonanginal pain syndromes. Sensitivities of the derived partitions for detection of myocardial ischemia were tested in an additional 150 patients with a high likelihood of coronary disease, including 100 patients with angiographically demonstrated coronary obstruction and 50 patients with stable angina. In contrast to the 68{\%} (102 of 150 subjects) sensitivity of standard exercise electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of disease in this population, the sensitivity of an ST segment/heart rate slope partition of 2.4 muV/beats/min was 95{\%} (142 of 150 subjects, p {\textless} 0.001), and the sensitivity of a ST segment/heart rate index partition of 1.6 muV/beats/min was 91{\%} (137 of 150 subjects, p {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {Background Acute transmural ischemia increases QRS duration and R-wave amplitude owing to depressed intramyocardial activation. Theoretically, when myocardial injury is confined to the epicardium, the intramyocardial activation is preserved without affecting QRS duration. Objective The purpose of this study was to distinguish epicardial from transmural myocardial injury based on the analysis of the QRS complex in leads with ST segment elevation. Methods Electrophysiological effects of epicardial injury induced by topical application (n = 7) or intrapericardial injection (n = 10) of potassium were assessed in pigs in local electrograms recorded with needles in the left ventricle and in the peripheral 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), respectively, and were compared with transmural injury induced by acute left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion in the same pig. Results Epicardial application of 50 mM potassium induced ST segment elevation in epicardial (0.2 ± 0.06 to 0.5 ± 0.09 mV; P {\textless}.05) but not in midmyocardial local electrograms (0.1 ± 0.07 to -0.1 ± 0.09 mV). Local midmyocardial activation times were not affected by epicardial applied potassium (182 ± 5.9 vs. 183 ± 5.8 ms) but increased significantly during acute LAD occlusion (246 ± 20.9 ms; P {\textless}.01). Intrapericardial injected potassium induced ST segment elevation on average in nine of 12 ECG leads but did not change QRS duration and R-wave amplitude. Acute LAD occlusion induced ST segment elevation (five of 12 leads) associated with increased QRS duration (69 ± 1.2 to 89 ± 3.6 ms; P {\textless}.001) and R-wave amplitude (0.1 ± 0.01 to 0.7 ± 0.09 mV; P {\textless}.001) in the ECG. Conclusion Transmural but not epicardial myocardial injury delays intramural local activation and is associated with QRS prolongation and enlarged R-wave amplitude in leads with ST segment elevation. This differential ECG pattern may help to distinguish acute pericarditis (epicardial injury) from acute transmural ischemia in clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2010 Heart Rhythm Society All rights reserved.},

Many Homer proteins can also self-associate through a coiled-coil domain that allows their multimerisation. In other tissues, especially neurons, Homer anchors proteins embedded in the surface membrane to the Ca(2+) release channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and can anchor membrane or cytosolic proteins to the cytoskeleton. Although this anchoring aspect of Homer function has not been extensively investigated in muscle, there are consensus sequences for Homer binding in the RyR and on many of the proteins that it interacts with in the massive RyR ion channel complex. In this review we explore the potential of Homer to contribute to a variety of cell processes in muscle and neurons that also involve RyR channels.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare surface ECGs with electrograms (EGM) that are available from implanted devices for the ability to detect ischemic ST segment changes during normal sinus (NS) and ventricular paced (VP) rhythms. METHODS AND RESULTS: ECG leads I, II, and V2, right atrial ring to left pectoral patch (representing the can of the device), right ventricular ring to left pectoral patch, and right atrial ring to right ventricular ring EGM were recorded continuously during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. One balloon inflation ({\textgreater} or = 60 sec) was analyzed from each of 22 NS and 22 VP subjects. The parameter AST was defined as the maximum absolute ST segment deviation (from isoelectric) during the first 60 seconds of inflation, measured relative to the baseline (preinflation) ST segment deviation. For EGM, a normalized deltaST was defined as the AST divided by the ratio of QRS amplitudes of EGM to ECG. During NS, the deltaST for EGM (0.43 mV) was significantly larger than that of ECG (0.09 mV, P = 0.0001) but the normalized deltaST for EGM (0.11 mV) was comparable to that of ECG (0.09 mV, P = 0.45). During VP, the AST for EGM (1.08 mV) was significantly larger than that of ECG (0.17 mV, P = 0.0001), but the normalized AST for EGM (0.11 mV) was significantly smaller than that of ECG (0.17 mV, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: During both NS and VP, ischemic ST segment changes were significantly larger in EGM than in ECG. Much of this difference appears to be related to larger amplitudes of EGM signals. (J},

abstract = {As a minimally invasive surgery to treat left atrial (LA) fibrillation, catheter based ablation uses high radio-frequency energy to eliminate potential sources of the abnormal electrical events, especially around the ostia of pulmonary veins (PV). Due to large structural variations of the PV drainage pattern, a personalized LA model is helpful to translate a generic ablation strategy to a specific patient's anatomy. Overlaying the LA model onto 2D fluoroscopic images provides valuable visual guidance during surgery. A holistic shape model is not accurate enough to represent the whole shape population of the LA. In this paper, we propose a part based LA model (including the chamber, appendage, and four major PVs) and each part is a much simpler anatomical structure compared to the holistic one. Our approach works on un-gated C-arm CT, where thin boundaries between the LA blood pool and surrounding tissues are often blurred due to the cardiac motion artifacts (which presents a big challenge compared to the highly contrasted gated CT/MRI). To avoid segmentation leakage, the shape prior is exploited in a model based approach to segment the LA parts. However, independent detection of each part is not optimal and its robustness needs further improvement (especially for the appendage and PVs). We propose to enforce a statistical shape constraint during the estimation of pose parameters (position, orientation, and size) of different parts. Our approach is computationally efficient, taking about 1.5 s to process a volume with 256 256 250 voxels. Experiments on 469 C-arm CT datasets demonstrate its robustness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate risk stratification is crucial for effective treatment planning after myocardial infarction (MI). Previous studies suggest that the peri-infarct border zone may be an important arrhythmogenic substrate. In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis that the extent of the peri-infarct zone quantified by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is an independent predictor of post-MI mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 144 patients with documented coronary artery disease and abnormal myocardial delayed enhancement (MDE) consistent with MI. A computer-assisted, semiautomatic algorithm quantified the total infarct size and divided it into the core and peri-infarct regions based on signal-intensity thresholds ({\textgreater}3 SDs and 2 to 3 SDs above remote normal myocardium, respectively). The peri-infarct zone was normalized as a percentage of the total infarct size ({\%}MDE(periphery)). After a median follow-up of 2.4 years, 29 (20{\%}) patients died. Patients with an above-median {\%}MDE(periphery) were at higher risk for death compared with those with a below-median {\%}MDE(periphery) (28{\%} versus 13{\%}, log-rank P{\textless}0.01). Multivariable analysis showed that left ventricular systolic volume index and {\%}MDE(periphery) were the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for {\%}MDE(periphery), 1.45 per 10{\%} increase; P=0.002) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR, 1.51 per 10{\%} increase; P=0.009). Similarly, after adjusting for age and left ventricular ejection fraction, {\%}MDE(periphery) maintained strong and independent associations with all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.42; P=0.005) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR, 1.49; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a prior MI, the extent of the peri-infarct zone characterized by CMR provides incremental prognostic value beyond left ventricular systolic volume index or ejection fraction. Infarct characteristics by CMR may prove to be a unique and valuable noninvasive predictor of post-MI mortality.},

abstract = {Rationale: beta-Adrenergic receptor stimulation produces sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) overload and delayed afterdepolarizations in isolated ventricular myocytes. How delayed afterdepolarizations are synchronized to overcome the source-sink mismatch and produce focal arrhythmia in the intact heart remains unknown. Objective: To determine whether local beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation produces spatiotemporal synchronization of delayed afterdepolarizations and to examine the effects of tissue geometry and cell-cell coupling on the induction of focal arrhythmia. Methods and Results: Simultaneous optical mapping of transmembrane potential and Ca(2+) transients was performed in normal rabbit hearts during subepicardial injections (50 muL) of norepinephrine (NE) or control (normal Tyrode's solution). Local NE produced premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) from the injection site that were dose-dependent (low-dose [30-60 mumol/L], 0.45+/-0.62 PVCs per injection; high-dose [125-250 mumol/L], 1.33+/-1.46 PVCs per injection; P{\textless}0.0001) and were inhibited by propranolol. NE-induced PVCs exhibited abnormal voltage-Ca(2+) delay at the initiation site and were inhibited by either sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibition or reduced perfusate [Ca(2+)], which indicates a Ca(2+)-mediated mechanism. NE-induced PVCs were more common at right ventricular than at left ventricular sites (1.48+/-1.50 versus 0.55+/-0.89, P{\textless}0.01), and this was unchanged after chemical ablation of endocardial Purkinje fibers, which suggests that source-sink interactions may contribute to the greater propensity to right ventricular PVCs. Partial gap junction uncoupling with carbenoxolone (25 mumol/L) increased focal activity (2.18+/-1.43 versus 1.33+/-1.46 PVCs per injection, P{\textless}0.05), which further supports source-sink balance as a critical mediator of Ca(2+)-induced PVCs. Conclusions: These data provide the first experimental demonstration that localized beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation produces spatiotemporal synchronization of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) overload and release in the intact heart and highlight the critical nature of source-sink balance in initiating focal arrhythmias.},

abstract = {To clarify the source of electrocardiographic ST depression associated with ischemia, a sheep model of subendocardial ischemia was developed in which simultaneous epicardial and endocardial ST potentials were mapped, and a computer model using the bidomain technique was developed to explain the results. To produce ischemia in different territories of the myocardium in the same animal, the left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex coronary artery were partially constricted in sequence. Results from 36 sheep and the computer simulation are reported. The distributions of epicardial potentials from either ischemic source were very similar (r=0.77+/-0.14, P{\textless}0.0001), with both showing ST depression on the free wall of the left ventricle and no association between the ST depression and the ischemic region. However, endocardial potentials showed that ST elevation was directly associated with the region of reduced blood flow. Insulating the heart from the surrounding tissue with plastic increased the magnitude of epicardial ST potentials, which was consistent with an intramyocardial source. Increasing the percent stenosis of a coronary artery increased epicardial ST depression at the lateral boundary and resulted in ST elevation starting from the ischemic center as ischemia became transmural. Computer simulation using the bidomain model reproduced the epicardial ST patterns and suggested that the ST depression was generated at the lateral boundary between ischemic and normal territories. ST depression on the epicardium reflected the position of this lateral boundary. The boundaries of ischemic territories are shared, and only those appearing on the free wall contribute to external ST potential fields. These effects explain why body surface ST depression does not localize cardiac ischemia in humans.},

The data demonstrated that dobutamine is a powerful inotropic agent at a dose that has a relatively small influence on heart rate.

In patients with severe coronary artery disease dobutamine resulted in a much smaller increase in coronary perfusion, and the pattern of perfusion became more Inhomogeneous.

abstract = {Analysis of the rate-related change in exercise-induced ST segment depression using the exercise ST segment/heart rate slope and ST segment/heart rate index can improve the accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) for the identification of patients with coronary artery disease, recognition of patients with anatomically or functionally severe coronary obstruction and detection of patients at increased risk for future coronary events. These methods provide a more physiologic approach to analysis of the ST segment response to exercise by adjusting the apparent severity of ischemia for the corresponding increase in myocardial oxygen demand, which in turn can be linearly related to increasing heart rate. Solid-angle theory provides a model for the linear relation of ST segment depression to heart rate during exercise and a framework for understanding the relation of the ST segment/heart rate slope to the presence and extent of coronary artery disease. False positive and false negative test results of the heart rate-adjusted methods are well known in selected populations and require further clarification. Application of these methods is also highly dependent on the type of exercise protocol, number of ECG leads examined, timing of ST segment measurement relative to the J point and accuracy and precision of ST segment measurement. These methodologic details have been an important limitation to test application when traditional protocols and measurement procedures are required. When applied with attention to required details, the heart rate-adjusted methods can improve the usefulness of the exercise ECG in a range of clinically relevant populations. {\textcopyright} 1995 American College of Cardiology.},

abstract = {Using vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), we sought to determine the contribution of vagal afferents to efferent control of cardiac function. In anesthetized dogs, the right and left cervical vagosympathetic trunks were stimulated in the intact state, following ipsilateral or contralateral vagus nerve transection (VNTx), and then following bilateral VNTx. Stimulations were performed at currents from 0.25 to 4.0 mA, frequencies from 2 to 30 Hz, and a 500-$\mu$s pulse width. Right or left VNS evoked significantly greater current- and frequency-dependent suppression of chronotropic, inotropic, and lusitropic function subsequent to sequential VNTx. Bradycardia threshold was defined as the current first required for a 5{\%} decrease in heart rate. The threshold for the right vs. left vagus-induced bradycardia in the intact state (2.91 ± 0.18 and 3.47 ± 0.20 mA, respectively) decreased significantly with right VNTx (1.69 ± 0.17 mA for right and 3.04 ± 0.27 mA for left) and decreased further following bilateral VNTx (1.29 ± 0.16 mA for right and 1.74 ± 0.19 mA for left). Similar effects were observed following left VNTx. The thresholds for afferent-mediated effects on cardiac parameters were 0.62 ± 0.04 and 0.65 ± 0.06 mA with right and left VNS, respectively, and were reflected primarily as augmentation. Afferent-mediated tachycardias were maintained following $\beta$-blockade but were eliminated by VNTx. The increased effectiveness and decrease in bradycardia threshold with sequential VNTx suggest that 1) vagal afferents inhibit centrally mediated parasympathetic efferent outflow and 2) the ipsilateral and contralateral vagi exert a substantial buffering capacity. The intact threshold reflects the interaction between multiple levels of the cardiac neural hierarchy.},

@article{Ni1998,
abstract = {In mapping the electrical activity of the heart, interpolation of electric potentials plays two important roles. First, it permits the estimation of potentials in regions that could not be sampled or where signal quality was poor, and second, it supports the construction of isopotential lines and surfaces for visualization. The difficulty in developing robust interpolation techniques for cardiac applications lies in the abrupt change in potential in the vicinity of the activation wave front. Despite the resulting nonlinearities in spatial potential distributions, simple linear interpolation methods are the current standard and the resulting errors due to aliasing can be large if electrode spacing does not lie on the order of 0.5-2 mm--the thickness of the activation wave front. We have developed a novel interpolation method that is based on two observations specific to the spread of excitation in the heart: (1) that propagation velocity changes smoothly within a region large enough to contain several measurement electrodes and (2) that electrogram morphology varies very little in the neighborhood of each sample point except for a time shift in the potential wave forms. The resulting interpolation scheme breaks the interpolation of one highly nonlinear variable--extracellular potential--into two separate interpolations of variables with much less drastic spatial variation--activation time and electrogram morphology. We have applied this method to potentials originally recorded at 1.5 mm spacing and then subsampled at a range of densities for testing of the interpolation. The results based both on reconstruction of isopotential contour maps and statistical comparison showed significant improvement of this novel approach over standard linear techniques. The applications of the new method include improved determination of electrophysiological parameters such as spatial gradients of potential and the path of cardiac activation and recovery, estimation of electrograms at desired locations, and visualization of electric potential distributions.},

abstract = {Despite a century of research and practice, the clinical accuracy of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to detect and localize myocardial ischemia remains less than satisfactory. Myocardial ischemia occurs when the heart does not receive adequate oxygen-rich blood to keep up with its metabolic requirements, and severe ischemia can lead to myocardial infarction and life-threatening arrhythmias. Early and accurate detection is an essential component of managing this condition. Ischemia is known to be a dynamic condition that reflects a changing imbalance between blood supply and metabolic demand so that it is natural that examination under physical stress conditions or exercise testing (ET) is in widespread clinical use. However, ET is characterized by poor sensitivity (68{\%}) and specificity (77{\%}), limiting its diagnostic usefulness and providing the motivation to address some gaps in our understanding of myocardial ischemia and its ECG signature. This dissertation is composed of three studies. The aim of the first study was to evaluate the conventionally held mechanisms for nontransmural ischemia using intramural electrodes to measure three-dimensional potential distributions in the ventricles of animals exposed to acute ischemia. We demonstrated that contrary to accepted dogma, the electrocar- diographic response of acute myocardial ischemia originated throughout the ventricular wall, i.e., in the subendocardium, midmyocardium, or the subepicardium, under various conditions. Our goal in the second study was to evaluate whether acute myocardial ischemia follows a similar pattern of spatial and temporal evolution as seen in myocardial infarction. Our findings show that the spatial and temporal evolution of acute ischemia is characterized by multiple distinct regions that expand in all three directions, with maximal expansion in the circumferential direction, especially in the early stages of ischemic development. Furthermore, with increased stress, these regions continue to expand and eventually merge into one another, and in the extreme become transmural. The progression of myocardial infarction, by contrast, was very quickly transmural in extent and formed a cohesive block of affected tissues. The aim of the third study was to evaluate the sensitivity of epicardial electrical markers of acute ischemia relative to direct evidence of ischemia derived from intramural electro- grams. The key finding from this study is that the epicardial T-wave is a more sensitive index of acute ischemia than epicardial ST segment changes, especially in the early stages of acute ischemia development.},

abstract = {Diverse forms of injury and stress evoke a hypertrophic growth response in adult cardiac myocytes, which is characterized by an increase in cell size, enhanced protein synthesis, assembly of sarcomeres, and reactivation of fetal genes, often culminating in heart failure and sudden death. Given the emerging roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulation of cellular phenotypes, we searched for miRNAs that were regulated during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We describe {\textgreater}12 miRNAs that are up- or down-regulated in cardiac tissue from mice in response to transverse aortic constriction or expression of activated calcineurin, stimuli that induce pathological cardiac remodeling. Many of these miRNAs were similarly regulated in failing human hearts. Forced overexpression of stress-inducible miRNAs was sufficient to induce hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes. Similarly, cardiac overexpression of miR-195, which was up-regulated during cardiac hypertrophy, resulted in pathological cardiac growth and heart failure in transgenic mice. These findings reveal an important role for specific miRNAs in the control of hypertrophic growth and chamber remodeling of the heart in response to pathological signaling and point to miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets in heart disease.},

Partitions chosen by the method of percentile estimation to include 95{\%} of normal subjects remained highly specific in subjects with nonanginal pain syndromes. Sensitivities of the derived partitions for detection of myocardial ischemia were tested in an additional 150 patients with a high likelihood of coronary disease, including 100 patients with angiographically demonstrated coronary obstruction and 50 patients with stable angina. In contrast to the 68{\%} (102 of 150 subjects) sensitivity of standard exercise electrocardiographic criteria for the detection of disease in this population, the sensitivity of an ST segment/heart rate slope partition of 2.4 muV/beats/min was 95{\%} (142 of 150 subjects, p less than 0.001), and the sensitivity of a delta ST segment/heart rate index partition of 1.6 muV/beats/min was 91{\%} (137 of 150 subjects, p less than 0.001). Analysis of receiver-operating curves confirmed the superior performance of the heart rate-adjusted indexes throughout a wide range of test specificities.

abstract = {Atrial arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter or fibrillation, are frequent indications for catheter ablation. Recorded intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) are, however, mostly evaluated subjectively by the physicians. In this paper, we present a method to quantitatively extract the wave direction and the local conduction velocity from one single beat in a circular mapping catheter signal. We simulated typical clinical EGMs to validate the method. We then showed that even with noise, the average directional error was below 10(°) and the average velocity error was below 5.4 cm/s. In a realistic atrial simulation, the method could clearly distinguish between stimuli from different pulmonary veins. We further analyzed eight clinical data segments from three patients in normal sinus rhythm and with stimulation. We obtained stable wave directions for each segment and conduction velocities between 70 and 115 cm/s. We conclude that the method allows for easy quantitative analysis of single macroscopic wavefronts in intracardiac EGMs, such as during atrial flutter or in typical clinical stimulation procedures after termination of atrial fibrillation. With corresponding simulated data, it can provide an interface to personalize electrophysiological (EP) models. Furthermore, it could be integrated into EP navigation systems to provide quantitative data of high diagnostic value to the physician.},

abstract = {Stress echocardiography is the combination of 2D echocardiography with a physical, pharmacological or electrical stress. The diagnostic end point for the detection of myocardial ischemia is the induction of a transient worsening in regional function during stress. Stress echocardiography provides similar diagnostic and prognostic accuracy as radionuclide stress perfusion imaging, but at a substantially lower cost, without environmental impact, and with no biohazards for the patient and the physician. Among different stresses of comparable diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, semisupine exercise is the most used, dobutamine the best test for viability, and dipyridamole the safest and simplest pharmacological stress and the most suitable for combined wall motion coronary flow reserve assessment. The additional clinical benefit of myocardial perfusion contrast echocardiography and myocardial velocity imaging has been inconsistent to date, whereas the potential of adding ‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}} coronary flow reserve evaluation of left anterior descending coronary artery by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography adds another potentially important dimension to stress echocardiography. New emerging fields of application taking advantage from the versatility of the technique are Doppler stress echo in valvular heart disease and in dilated cardiomyopathy. In spite of its dependence upon operator's training, stress echocardiography is today the best (most cost-effective and risk-effective) possible imaging choice to achieve the still elusive target of sustainable cardiac imaging in the field of noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease.},

abstract = {Computational models of cardiac electromechanics (EM) are increasingly being applied to clinical problems, with patient-specific models being generated from high fidelity imaging and used to simulate patient physiology, pathophysiology and response to treatment. Current structured meshes are limited in their ability to fully represent the detailed anatomical data available from clinical images and capture complex and varied anatomy with limited geometric accuracy. In this paper, we review the state of the art in image-based personalization of cardiac anatomy for biophysically detailed, strongly coupled EM modeling, and present our own tools for the automatic building of anatomically and structurally accurate patient-specific models. Our method relies on using high resolution unstructured meshes for discretizing both physics, electrophysiology and mechanics, in combination with efficient, strongly scalable solvers necessary to deal with the computational load imposed by the large number of degrees of freedom of these meshes. These tools permit automated anatomical model generation and strongly coupled EM simulations at an unprecedented level of anatomical and biophysical detail.},

abstract = {Functioning of the cardiac conduction system depends critically on its structure and its complement of ion channels. Therefore, the aim of this study was to document both the structure and ion channel expression of the left and right ventricular His-Purkinje networks, as we have previously done for the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. A three-dimensional (3D) anatomical computer model of the His-Purkinje network of the rabbit heart was constructed after staining the network by immunoenzyme labelling of a marker protein, middle neurofilament. The bundle of His is a ribbon-like structure and the architecture of the His-Purkinje network differs between the left and right ventricles. The 3D model is able to explain the breakthrough points of the action potential on the ventricular epicardium during sinus rhythm. Using quantitative PCR, the expression levels of the major ion channels were measured in the free running left and right Purkinje fibres of the rabbit heart. Expression of ion channels differs from that of the working myocardium and can explain the specialised electrical activity of the Purkinje fibres as suggested by computer simulations; the expression profile of the left Purkinje fibres is more specialised than that of the right Purkinje fibres. The structure and ion channel expression of the Purkinje fibres are highly specialised and tailored to the functioning of the system. The His-Purkinje network in the left ventricle is more developed than that in the right ventricle and this may explain its greater clinical importance. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) is reported to reduce the burden of ventricular tachyarrhythmias [ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF)] in cardiomyopathy patients, but the mechanisms behind this benefit are unknown. In addition, the relative contribution to cardiac innervation of the middle cervical ganglion (MCG), which may contain cardiac neurons and is not removed during this procedure, is unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare sympathetic innervation of the heart via the MCG vs. stellate ganglia, assess effects of bilateral CSD on cardiac function and VT/VF, and determine changes in cardiac sympathetic innervation after CSD to elucidate mechanisms of benefit in 6 normal and 18 infarcted pigs. Electrophysiological and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated at baseline, during bilateral stellate stimulation, and during bilateral MCG stimulation in 6 normal and 12 infarcted animals. Bilateral CSD (removal of bilateral stellates and T2 ganglia) was then performed and MCG stimulation repeated. In addition, in 18 infarcted animals VT/VF inducibility was assessed before and after CSD. In infarcted hearts, MCG stimulation resulted in greater chronotropic and inotropic response than stellate ganglion stimulation. Bilateral CSD acutely reduced VT/VF inducibility by 50{\%} in infarcted hearts and prolonged global activation recovery interval. CSD mitigated effects of MCG stimulation on dispersion of repolarization and T-peak to T-end interval in infarcted hearts, without causing hemodynamic compromise. These data demonstrate that the MCG provides significant cardiac sympathetic innervation before CSD and adequate sympathetic innervation after CSD, maintaining hemodynamic stability. Bilateral CSD reduces VT/VF inducibility by improving electrical stability in infarcted hearts in the setting of sympathetic activation.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY Sympathetic activation in myocardial infarction leads to arrhythmias and worsens heart failure. Bilateral cardiac sympathetic denervation reduces ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation inducibility and mitigates effects of sympathetic activation on dispersion of repolarization and T-peak to T-end interval in infarcted hearts. Hemodynamic stability is maintained, as innervation via the middle cervical ganglion is not interrupted.},

abstract = {A collaborative framework was initiated to establish a community resource of ground truth segmentations from cardiac MRI. Multi-site, multi-vendor cardiac MRI datasets comprising 95 patients (73 men, 22 women; mean age 62.73. ±. 11.24. years) with coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction, were randomly selected from data made available by the Cardiac Atlas Project ( Fonseca et al., 2011). Three semi- and two fully-automated raters segmented the left ventricular myocardium from short-axis cardiac MR images as part of a challenge introduced at the STACOM 2011 MICCAI workshop ( Suinesiaputra et al., 2012). Consensus myocardium images were generated based on the Expectation-Maximization principle implemented by the STAPLE algorithm ( Warfield et al., 2004). The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values ranged between 0.63 and 0.85, 0.60 and 0.98, 0.56 and 0.94, and 0.83 and 0.92, respectively, against the STAPLE consensus. Spatial and temporal agreement varied in different amounts for each rater. STAPLE produced high quality consensus images if the region of interest was limited to the area of discrepancy between raters. To maintain the quality of the consensus, an objective measure based on the candidate automated rater performance distribution is proposed. The consensus segmentation based on a combination of manual and automated raters were more consistent than any particular rater, even those with manual input. The consensus is expected to improve with the addition of new automated contributions. This resource is open for future contributions, and is available as a test bed for the evaluation of new segmentation algorithms, through the Cardiac Atlas Project ( www.cardiacatlas.org). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The influence of cardiac sympathetic innervation on electrical activation in normal and chronically infarcted ventricular myocardium is not understood. Yorkshire pigs with normal hearts (NL, n = 12) or anterior myocardial infarction (MI, n = 9) underwent high-resolution mapping of the anteroapical left ventricle at baseline and during left and right stellate ganglion stimulation (LSGS and RSGS, respectively). Conduction velocity (CV), activation times (ATs), and directionality of propagation were measured. Myocardial fiber orientation was determined using diffusion tensor imaging and histology. Longitudinal CV (CVL) was increased by RSGS (0.98 ± 0.11 vs. 1.2 ± 0.14m/s, P {\textless} 0.001) but not transverse CV (CVT). This increase was abrogated by $\beta$-adrenergic receptor and gap junction (GJ) blockade. Neither CVL nor CVT was increased by LSGS. In the peri-infarct region, both RSGS and LSGS shortened ARIs in sinus rhythm (423 ± 37 vs. 322 ± 30 ms, P {\textless} 0.001, and 423 ± 36 vs. 398 ± 36 ms, P = 0.035, respectively) and altered activation patterns in all animals. CV, as estimated by mean ATs, increased in a directionally dependent manner by RSGS (14.6 ± 1.2 vs. 17.3 ± 1.6 ms, P = 0.015), associated with GJ lateralization. RSGS and LSGS inhomogeneously modulated AT and induced relative or absolute functional activation delay in parts of the mapped regions in 75 and 67{\%}, respectively, in MI animals, and in 0 and 15{\%}, respectively, in control animals (P {\textless} 0.001 for both). In conclusion, sympathoexcitation increases CV in normal myocardium and modulates activation propagation in peri-infarcted ventricular myocardium. These data demonstrate functional control of arrhythmogenic peri-infarct substrates by sympathetic nerves and in part explain the temporal nature of arrhythmogenesis.NEW {\&} NOTEWORTHY This study demonstrates regional control of conduction velocity in normal hearts by sympathetic nerves. In infarcted hearts, however, not only is modulation of propagation heterogeneous, some regions showed paradoxical conduction slowing.

abstract = {Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to induce thermal damage to the left atrium (LA) in an attempt to isolate AF circuits. This injury can be seen using delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI). Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe DE-MRI findings of the LA in the acute and chronic stages postablation. Methods: Twenty-five patients were scanned at two time points postablation. The first group (n = 10) underwent DE-MRI at 24 hours and at 3 months. The second group (n = 16) was scanned at 3 months and at 6 or 9 months. One patient had three scans (24 hours, 3 months, 9 months) and was included in both groups. The location and extent of enhancement were then analyzed between both groups. Results: The median change in LA wall injury between 24 hours and 3 months was -6.38{\%} (range -11.7{\%} to 12.58{\%}). The median change in LA wall injury between 3 months and later follow-up was +2.0{\%} (range -4.0{\%} to 6.58{\%}). There appears to be little relationship between the enhancement at 24 hours and 3 months (R2 = 0.004). In contrast, a strong correlation is seen at 3 months and later follow-up (R2 = 0.966). Qualitative comparison revealed a stronger qualitative relationship between MRI findings at 3 months and later follow-up than at 24 hours and 3 months. Conclusion: RF-induced scar appears to have formed by 3 months postablation. At 24 hours postablation, DE-MRI enhancement appears consistent with a transient inflammatory response rather than stable LA scar formation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Heart Rhythm Society.},

abstract = {The complex pathophysiology of human arrhythmias has proven difficult to model. Direct correlations between the traditional arrhythmia mechanisms, including abnormal excitability, conduction, or repolarization and underlying molecular or cellular biology are poorly defined, as the primary etiologies of many human arrhythmias remain unknown. Since the causes of several arrhythmic syndromes have been identified, genetic models reproducing the mechanisms of these arrhythmias have become feasible. Initial murine modeling has revealed that in many cases the pathophysiology of the respective human disease is more complex than had been suspected. Insights from human genetic studies and animal models strongly suggest that the primary molecular defects may contribute at many stages in the causal chain leading to arrhythmia. The comprehensive analysis of each arrhythmia will require knowledge not only of the membrane effects of the primary defects, but also downstream intracellular signals, the developmental results of these perturbations, and the integration of compensatory responses and environmental factors. Precise modeling will require not only the mutation of specific residues in known disease genes, but also the systematic study of each of the many steps in arrhythmogenesis. Ultimately, such models will enable unbiased screens for disease mechanisms and novel therapies.},

Loss of signal due to blood flow, partial volume effects and significant variation of surface grey value appearance make this a difficult problem. We integrate various sources of prior knowledge learned from annotated image data into a deformable model. Inter-individual shape variation is represented by a statistical point distribution model, and the spatial relationship of the epi- and endocardium is modeled by adapting two coupled triangular surface meshes. To robustly accommodate variation of grey value appearance around the myocardiac surface, a prior parametric spatially varying feature model is established by classification of grey value surface profiles. Quantitative validation of 121 3D MRI datasets in end-diastolic (end-systolic) phase demonstrates accuracy and robustness, with 2.45 mm (2.84 mm) mean deviation from manual segmentation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Catheter-based electrophysiological studies of the epicardium are limited to regions near the coronary vessels or require transthoracic access. We have developed a statistical approach by which to estimate high-resolution maps of epicardial activation from very low-resolution multi-electrode venous catheter measurements. This technique uses a linear estimation model that derives a relationship between venous catheter measurements and unmeasured epicardial sites from a set of previously recorded, high-resolution epicardial activation-time maps used as a training data set based on the spatial covariance of the measurement sites. We performed 14 dog experiments with various interventions to create an epicardial activation-time map database. This database included a total of 592 epicardial activation maps which were recorded using a sock array placed on the ventricles of dog hearts. We present five approaches, which examined sequential addition and removal of maps to select a generalized training set for the estimation technique. The selection consisted of choosing a subset of epicardial ectopic activation-time maps from the database of beats which resulted in estimation accuracy levels better than or at least similar to using all the maps in database. Our aim was to minimize the redundancy in the database and to be able to guide the eventual procedures required to obtain training data from open-chest surgery patients. The results from this study illustrated this redundancy and suggested that by including an optimal subset (around 100 maps) of the full database the estimation technique was able to perform as well as and even in some cases better than including all the maps in the database. The results also suggest that such an approach is feasible for providing accurate reconstruction of complete epicardial activation-time maps in a clinical setting and with fewer maps we can obtain similar reconstruction accuracy levels. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to the traditional method which requires user-interaction to identify classes, the unsupervised grow-cut algorithm (UGC) starts with a random number of seed points and automatically converges to a natural segmentation. This is useful when deriving classes from large image datasets for applications such as region-based image retrieval. The algorithm has been tested on a subset of thirty medical images derived from the Image CLEF med database and 300 natural images from the Berkeley dataset. The unsupervised grow-cut algorithm has been compared against the Mean Shift method and Normalized Cut method. The segmentation outcome of the UGC algorithm is comparable with the other two methods. The number of classes derived by the UGC is independent of the number of initial seed points. Incorporating cellular automata makes the computational complexity of the algorithm independent of the dimension of the image and feature space.},

abstract = {Ventricular pressure-volume relationships have become well established as the most rigorous and comprehensive ways to assess intact heart function. Thanks to advances in miniature sensor technology, this approach has been successfully translated to small rodents, allowing for detailed characterization of cardiovascular function in genetically engineered mice, testing effects of pharmacotherapies and studying disease conditions. This method is unique for providing measures of left ventricular (LV) performance that are more specific to the heart and less affected by vascular loading conditions. Here we present descriptions and movies for procedures employing this method (anesthesia, intubation and surgical techniques, calibrations). We also provide examples of hemodynamics measurements obtained from normal mice/rats, and from animals with cardiac hypertrophy/heart failure, and describe values for various useful load-dependent and load-independent indexes of LV function obtained using different types of anesthesia. The completion of the protocol takes 1-4 h (depending on the experimental design/end points).},

abstract = {High-resolution (11.7 T) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological approaches have been employed in tandem to characterize the secondary damage suffered by the murine myocardium following the initial insult caused by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). I/R-induced changes in the myocardium were examined in five separate groups at the following time points after I/R: 1 h, day 1, day 3, day 7, and day 14. The infarct volume increased from 1 h to day 1 post-I/R. Over time, the loss of myocardial function was observed to be associated with increased infarct volume and worsened regional wall motion. In the infarct region, I/R caused a decrease in end-systolic thickness coupled with small changes in end-diastolic thickness, leading to massive wall thickening abnormalities. In addition, compromised wall thickening was also observed in left ventricular regions adjacent to the infarct region. A tight correlation (r2 = 0.85) between measured MRI and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) infarct volumes was noted. Our observation that until day 3 post-I/R the infarct size as measured by TTC staining and MRI was much larger than that of the myocyte-silent regions in trichrome- or hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections is consistent with the literature and leads to the conclusion that at such an early phase, the infarct site contains structurally intact myocytes that are functionally compromised. Over time, such affected myocytes were noted to structurally disappear, resulting in consistent infarct sizes obtained from MRI and TTC as well as trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin analyses on day 7 following I/R. Myocardial remodeling following I/R includes secondary myocyte death followed by the loss of cardiac function over time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peak first derivative of femoral artery pressure (arterial dP/dtmax) derived from fluid-filled catheter remains questionable to assess left ventricular (LV) contractility during shock. The aim of this study was to test if arterial dP/dtmax is reliable for assessing LV contractility during various hemodynamic conditions such as endotoxin-induced shock and catecholamine infusion., METHODS: Ventricular pressure-volume data obtained with a conductance catheter and invasive arterial pressure obtained with a fluid-filled catheter were continuously recorded in 6 anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs. After a stabilization period, endotoxin was infused to induce shock. Catecholamines were transiently administrated during shock. Arterial dP/dtmax was compared to end-systolic elastance (Ees), the gold standard method for assessing LV contractility., RESULTS: Endotoxin-induced shock and catecholamine infusion lead to significant variations in LV contractility. Overall, significant correlation (r=0.51; p{\textless}0.001) but low agreement between the two methods were observed. However, a far better correlation with a good agreement were observed when positive-pressure ventilation induced an arterial pulse pressure variation (PPV){\textless}=11{\%} (r=0.77; p{\textless}0.001)., CONCLUSION: While arterial dP/dtmax and Ees were significantly correlated during various hemodynamic conditions, arterial dP/dtmax was more accurate for assessing LV contractility when adequate vascular filling, defined as PPV{\textless}=11{\%}, was achieved.},

abstract = {Cardiac repair following myocardial injury is restricted due to the limited proliferative potential of adult cardiomyocytes. The ability of mammalian cardiomyocytes to proliferate is lost shortly after birth as cardiomyocytes withdraw from the cell cycle and differentiate. We do not fully understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate this cell cycle withdrawal, although if we could it might lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for improving cardiac repair following myocardial injury. For the last decade, researchers have investigated cardiomyocyte cell cycle control, commonly using transgenic mouse models or recombinant adenoviruses to manipulate cell cycle regulators in vivo or in vitro. This review discusses cardiomyocyte cell cycle regulation and summarises recent data from studies manipulating the expressions and activities of cell cycle regulators in cardiomyocytes. The validity of therapeutic strategies that aim to reinstate the proliferative potential of cardiomyocytes to improve myocardial repair following injury will be discussed. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Methods and Results--In dogs, a large coronary artery was occluded to study AI and/or chronic infarction (n=18), and a second coronary artery was chronically instrumented with a reversible hydraulic occluder and Doppler flowmeter to study RII (n=8). At 3 days after surgery, cine MRI revealed reduced wall thickening in AI (5{\{}+/-{\}}6{\%} versus 33{\{}+/-{\}}6{\%} in normal, P{\textless}0.001).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure is characterized by left ventricular remodeling and reactivation of a fetal gene program; the underlying mechanisms are only partly understood. Here we provide evidence that cardiac microRNAs, recently discovered key regulators of gene expression, contribute to the transcriptional changes observed in heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac transcriptome analyses revealed striking similarities between fetal and failing human heart tissue. Using microRNA arrays, we discovered profound alterations of microRNA expression in failing hearts. These changes closely mimicked the microRNA expression pattern observed in fetal cardiac tissue. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated a striking concordance between regulated messenger RNA expression in heart failure and the presence of microRNA binding sites in the respective 3' untranslated regions. Messenger RNAs upregulated in the failing heart contained preferentially binding sites for downregulated microRNAs and vice versa. Mechanistically, transfection of cardiomyocytes with a set of fetal microRNAs induced cellular hypertrophy as well as changes in gene expression comparable to the failing heart. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a novel mode of regulation for the transcriptional changes in cardiac failure. Reactivation of a fetal microRNA program substantially contributes to alterations of gene expression in the failing human heart.},

abstract = {Ventricular repolarization was analyzed by measuring epicardial potential distributions in intact dogs with single or multiple ectopic foci and a minimum at the terminal site(s) of excitation. During the latter half of the T wave the distributions became more complex, and two maxima evolved from the initial one at each ectopic site. The measured epicardial potentials were simulated by means of a model of ST-T wave events that is suitable for study of single and multiple ectopic beats with fusion, a a model we call 'SI model.' Intracellular potentials around the ventricles during repolarization were calculated from measured excitation sequences and known action potential shapes. The extracellular potentials around the ventricles were computed from the intracellular ones by a simplified ventricular geometry. The satisfactory agreement between the theoretical and measured extracellular potential distribution shows that the complex changes which occur throughout the ST-T wave are predicted well on the basis of changes in the intracellular potential distributions. In contrast to the well known lability of the T wave from beat, the results show that for any single beat the events of repolarization proceed in an entirely repeatable and deterministic fashion. The results present a way to directly represent cardiac extracellular events during the ST-T wave, a method analogous to the use of isochromes during QRS, and they imply that in the future it will by possible to achieve a more precise quantitative understanding of the events of the ST-T wave than thus far has been possible for QRS. 76064632},

abstract = {Accentuated right ventricular (RV) gradients in action potential duration (APD) have been implicated in the arrhythmogenicity observed in Brugada syndrome in studies assuming that ventricular effective refractory periods (VERPs) vary in concert with APDs. The present experiments use a genetically modified mouse model to explore spatial heterogeneities in VERP that in turn might affect conduction velocity, thereby causing arrhythmias. Activation latencies, APDs and VERPs recorded during programmed S1S2 protocols were compared in RV and left ventricular (LV) epicardia and endocardia of Langendorff-perfused wild-type (WT) and Scn5a (+/-) hearts. Scn5a (+/-) and WT hearts showed similar patterns of shorter VERPs in RV than LV epicardia, and in epicardia than endocardia. However, Scn5a (+/-) hearts showed longer VERPs, despite shorter APD(90)s, than WT in all regions examined. The pro- and anti-arrhythmic agents flecainide and quinidine increased regional VERPs despite respectively decreasing and increasing the corresponding APD(90)s particularly in Scn5a (+/-) RV epicardia. In contrast, Scn5a (+/-) hearts showed greater VERP gradients between neighbouring regions, particularly RV transmural gradients, than WT (9.1 ± 1.1 vs. 5.7 ± 0.5 ms, p {\textless} 0.05, n = 12). Flecainide increased (to 21 ± 0.9 ms, p {\textless} 0.05, n = 6) but quinidine decreased (to 4.5 ± 0.5 ms, p {\textless} 0.05, n = 6) these gradients, particularly across the Scn5a (+/-) RV. Finally, Scn5a (+/-) hearts showed greater conduction slowing than WT following S2 stimuli, particularly with flecainide administration. Rather than arrhythmogenesis resulting from increased transmural repolarization gradients in an early, phase 2, reentrant excitation mechanism, the present findings implicate RV VERP gradients in potential reentrant mechanisms involving impulse conduction slowed by partial refractoriness.},

abstract = {The utility of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with acute left circumflex (LC) coronary occlusion is not established. This study aimed at determining the clinical, angiographic, and prognostic characteristics associated with the different patterns of ST-segment changes in patients with LC occlusion. A cohort of 314 patients with LC occlusion was categorized according to the admission ECG: (1) ST-segment elevation (ST-E, n=208), (2) isolated ST-segment depression in precordial leads (ST-D, n=62), and (3) negligible ST-segment changes (No-ST, n=44). Clinical variables, coronary angiography, and 30-day major adverse cardiac event (MACE) (in-hospital ventricular fibrillation, 1-month mortality, or heart failure) were compared among the three groups. As compared with No-ST, patients with ST-E or ST-D presented more advanced Killip class, higher troponin peak, lower LV ejection fraction, and were independently associated with MACE (odds ratio 5.43, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.09 to 27.20 and odds ratio 3.39, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.66 to 17.50, respectively). Patients with ST-D were tardily reperfused, had more often mitral regurgitation (23.1{\%} vs 9.3{\%} in ST-E and 3.3{\%} in No-ST, p=0.03), and presented ST-segment elevation in leads V7 to V9 in 12 of 16 cases with available recordings. Culprit proximal LC predominated in ST-D (41.9{\%}), distal LC in ST-E (42.8{\%}), and obtuse marginal in No-ST (59.1{\%}) (all p{\textless}0.01). The No-ST had smaller coronary vessels and more collaterals. In conclusion, the three ST-segment patterns of LC occlusion identify patients with different clinical, angiographic, and prognostic characteristics. Patients with ST-depression pattern require a prompt reperfusion therapy and could be better recognized by recording leads V7 to V9.},

The speed and direction of propagation are found from polynomial "surfaces" fitted to space-time (x, y, z, t) coordinates of cardiac activity. The technique is applied to sinus rhythm and paced rhythm mapped with plunge needles at 396-466 sites in the canine myocardium. The method was validated on simulated 3-D plane and spherical waves. For simulated data, conduction velocities were estimated with an accuracy of 1{\%}-2{\%}. In experimental data, estimates of conduction speeds during paced rhythm were slower than those found during normal sinus rhythm. Vector directions were also found to differ between different types of beats. The technique was able to distinguish between premature ventricular contractions and sinus beats and between sinus and paced beats. The proposed approach to computing velocity vector fields provides an automated, physiological, and quantitative description of local electrical activity in 3-D tissue. This method may provide insight into abnormal conduction associated with fatal ventricular arrhythmias.},

abstract = {In this study, we consider the proposition that the criteria for the electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis of left bundle-branch block (LBBB) be revised, a proposition born from analysis of results of cardiac resynchronization therapy trials. The various ECG definitions for LBBB (or lack thereof) used in these trials are reviewed as are the results of the analysis of ECGs from patients with left ventricular conduction disturbances by Grant and Dodge (Am J Med. 1956;20:834-852) and the criteria for the ECG diagnosis of LBBB recommended by the World Health Organization and the International Society and Federation for Cardiology in 1985. These criteria stress that the QRS complex be notched or slurred, that the initial portion of the QRS complex (the "septal Q waves") be absent, and that the QRS duration be at least 120 milliseconds in duration. This is in contrast to the recent suggestion that the QRS complex has a minimum duration of 130 to 140 milliseconds. We conclude that the criteria for the ECG diagnosis of LBBB should be standardized to that recommended by the World Health Organization and International Society and Federation for Cardiology with retention of the minimum duration of 120 milliseconds and that the QRS prolongation should be not be gradual. However, we also conclude that in patients with LBBB being considered for cardiac resynchronization therapy, the duration of the QRS complex should be at least 130 milliseconds. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate that oncostatin M (OSM) is a major mediator of cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and remodeling during acute myocardial infarction (MI) and in chronic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Patients suffering from DCM show a strong and lasting increase of OSM expression and signaling. OSM treatment induces dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes and upregulation of stem cell markers and improves cardiac function after MI. Conversely, inhibition of OSM signaling suppresses cardiomyocyte remodeling after MI and in a mouse model of DCM, resulting in deterioration of heart function after MI but improvement of cardiac performance in DCM. We postulate that dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes initially protects stressed hearts but fails to support cardiac structure and function upon continued activation. Manipulation of OSM signaling provides a means to control the differentiation state of cardiomyocytes and cellular plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aging-related changes in platelet and monocyte interactions may contribute to adverse outcomes in sepsis but remain relatively unexamined. We hypothesized that differential platelet-monocyte aggregate (PMA) formation in older septic patients alters inflammatory responses and mortality.

METHODS: We prospectively studied 113 septic adults admitted to the intensive care unit with severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients were dichotomized a priori into one of two groups: older (age ≥ 65 years, n = 28) and younger (age {\textless} 65 years, n = 85). PMA levels were measured in whole blood via flow cytometry within 24 hours of admission. Plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-8, proinflammatory cytokines produced by monocytes upon PMA formation, were determined by commercial assays. Patients were followed for the primary outcome of 28-day, all-cause mortality.

RESULTS: Elevated PMA levels were associated with an increased risk of mortality in older septic patients (hazard ratio for mortality 5.64, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.64-49.61). This association remained after adjusting for potential confounding variables in multivariate regression. Receiver operating curve analyses demonstrated that PMA levels greater than or equal to 8.43{\%} best predicted 28-day mortality in older septic patients (area under the receiver operating curve 0.82). Plasma IL-6 and IL-8 levels were also significantly higher in older nonsurvivors. In younger patients, neither PMA levels nor plasma monokines were significantly associated with mortality.

CONCLUSIONS: Increased PMA formation, and associated proinflammatory monokine synthesis, predicts mortality in older septic patients. Although larger studies are needed, our findings suggest that heightened PMA formation in older septic patients may contribute to injurious inflammatory responses and an increased risk of mortality.},

abstract = {Objectives. We evaluated dobutamine stress electrocardiography for detecting potentially reversible contractile dysfunction or residual ischemia in the infarct-related area. Background. ST-T segment changes in pathologic Q wave leads during stress testing may reflect contractile reserve, inducible ischemia or passive mechanical stretching. Dobutamine echocardiography allows detection of contractile reserve at low doses and inducible ischemia at high doses. Methods. We used low (5 to 10 $\mu$g/kg body weight per min) and high doses (20 to 40 $\mu$g/kg per min) of dobutamine in 49 patients with a previous Q wave myocardial infarction and analyzed the relation between ST-T segment changes in pathologic Q wave leads and regional contraction. Results. At low dose dobutamine, regional contraction improved in the infarct-related area in 23 patients. New or further ST segment elevation and pseudonormalization of negative T waves developed at low doses more frequently in patients with than without contractile reserve (both p {\textless} 0.001), giving a sensitivity of 43.5{\%} and 60.9{\%} and a specificity of 100{\%} and 96.2{\%}, respectively. At high dose dobutamine (43 patients), new or further ST segment elevation and pseudonormalization of negative T waves, occurring beyond those observed at low doses, had a low predictive accuracy for contractile reserve (sensitivity of 9.5{\%} and 14.3{\%} and specificity of 68.2{\%} and 81.8{\%}, respectively). Pseudonormalization of negative T waves at high dose dobutamine was 100{\%} specific (but only 25{\%} sensitive) for homozonal ischemia. Conclusions. ST segment elevation or pseudonormalization of negative T waves, or both, is indicative of contractile reserve in the infarct-related area when either develops at low dose dobutamine, but may be associated with worsening or no change in contractile function at high doses.},

In contrast to humans, zebrafish and newts faithfully regenerate their hearts. Interestingly, regeneration is in both cases based on cardiomyocyte proliferation. In addition, mammalian cardiomyocytes proliferate during foetal development. Their proliferation reaches its maximum around chamber formation, stops shortly after birth, and subsequent heart growth is mostly achieved by an increase in cardiomyocyte size (hypertrophy). The underlying mechanisms that regulate cell cycle arrest and the switch from proliferation to hypertrophy are unclear. In this review, we highlight features of dividing cardiomyocytes, summarize the attempts to induce mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation, critically discuss methods commonly used for its detection, and explore the potential and problems of inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation to improve function in diseased hearts.},

Population characteristics and technical and methodologic factors, including publication year, number of electrocardiographic leads, exercise protocol, use of hyperventilation, definition of an abnormal ST response, exclusion of certain subgroups, and blinding of test interpretation were analyzed. Wide variability in sensitivity and specificity was found (mean sensitivity, 68{\%}; range, 23-100{\%}; SD, 16{\%}; and mean specificity, 77{\%}; range, 17-100{\%}; SD, 17{\%}). The four study characteristics found to be significantly and independently related to sensitivity were the treatment of equivocal test results, comparison with a "better" test such as thallium scintigraphy, exclusion of patients on digitalis, and publication year. The four variables found to be significantly and independently related to specificity were the treatment of upsloping ST depressions, the exclusion of subjects with prior infarction or left bundle branch block, and the use of preexercise hyperventilation. Stepwise linear regression explained less than 35{\%} of the variance in sensitivities and specificities reported in the 147 publications. There is wide variability in the reported accuracy of the exercise electrocardiogram. This variability is not explained by information reported in the medical literature.},

abstract = {Radiofrequency ablation is a promising procedure for treating atrial fibrillation (AF) that relies on accurate lesion delivery in the left atrial (LA) wall for success. Late Gadolinium Enhancement MRI (LGE MRI) at three months post-ablation has proven effective for noninvasive assessment of the location and extent of scar formation, which are important factors for predicting patient outcome and planning of redo ablation procedures. We have developed an algorithm for automatic classification in LGE MRI of scar tissue in the LA wall and have evaluated accuracy and consistency compared to manual scar classifications by expert observers. Our approach clusters voxels based on normalized intensity and was chosen through a systematic comparison of the performance of multivariate clustering on many combinations of image texture. Algorithm performance was determined by overlap with ground truth, using multiple overlap measures, and the accuracy of the estimation of the total amount of scar in the LA. Ground truth was determined using the STAPLE algorithm, which produces a probabilistic estimate of the true scar classification from multiple expert manual segmentations. Evaluation of the ground truth data set was based on both inter- and intra-observer agreement, with variation among expert classifiers indicating the difficulty of scar classification for a given a dataset. Our proposed automatic scar classification algorithm performs well for both scar localization and estimation of scar volume: for ground truth datasets considered easy, variability from the ground truth was low; for those considered difficult, variability from ground truth was on par with the variability across experts.},

abstract = {Vectors based on the adeno-associated virus (AAV) deliver therapeutic genes to muscle and heart at high efficiency and maintain transgene expression for long periods of time. Here we report about the synergistic effect on blood vessel formation of AAV vectors expressing the 165 aa isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165), a powerful activator of endothelial cells, and of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), which is required for vessel maturation. High titer AAV-VEGF165 and AAV-Ang-1 vector preparations were injected either alone or in combination in the normoperfused tibialis anterior muscle of rats. Long term expression of VEGF165 determined massive cellular infiltration of the muscle tissues over time, with the formation of a large set of new vessels. Strikingly, some of the cells infiltrating the treated muscles were found positive for markers of activated endothelial precursors (VEGFR-2/KDR and Tie-2) and for c-kit, an antigen expressed by pluripotent bone marrow stem cells. Expression of VEGF165 eventually resulted in the formation of structured vessels surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle cells. Presence of these arteriolae correlated with significantly increased blood perfusion in the injected areas. Co-expression of VEGF165 with angiopoietin-1-which did not display angiogenic effect per se-remarkably reduced leakage of vessels produced by VEGF165 alone.},

abstract = {Introduction The "Experimental Data and Geometric Analysis Repository", or EDGAR is an Internet-based archive of curated data that are freely distributed to the international research community for the application and validation of electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) techniques. The EDGAR project is a collaborative effort by the Consortium for ECG Imaging (CEI, ECG-imaging.org), and focused on two specific aims. One aim is to host an online repository that provides access to a wide spectrum of data, and the second aim is to provide a standard information format for the exchange of these diverse datasets. Methods The EDGAR system is composed of two interrelated components: 1) a metadata model, which includes a set of descriptive parameters and information, time signals from both the cardiac source and body-surface, and extensive geometric information, including images, geometric models, and measure locations used during the data acquisition/generation; and 2) a web interface. This web interface provides efficient, search, browsing, and retrieval of data from the repository. Results An aggregation of experimental, clinical and simulation data from various centers is being made available through the EDGAR project including experimental data from animal studies provided by the University of Utah (USA), clinical data from multiple human subjects provided by the Charles University Hospital (Czech Republic), and computer simulation data provided by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (Germany). Conclusions It is our hope that EDGAR will serve as a communal forum for sharing and distribution of cardiac electrophysiology data and geometric models for use in ECGI research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be used to visualise regions of fibrosis and scarring in the left atrium (LA) myocardium. This can be important for treatment stratification of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for assessment of treatment after radio frequency catheter ablation (RFCA). In this paper we present a standardised evaluation benchmarking framework for algorithms segmenting fibrosis and scar from LGE CMR images. The algorithms reported are the response to an open challenge that was put to the medical imaging community through an ISBI (IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging) workshop. METHODS The image database consisted of 60 multicenter, multivendor LGE CMR image datasets from patients with AF, with 30 images taken before and 30 after RFCA for the treatment of AF. A reference standard for scar and fibrosis was established by merging manual segmentations from three observers. Furthermore, scar was also quantified using 2, 3 and 4 standard deviations (SD) and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) methods. Seven institutions responded to the challenge: Imperial College (IC), Mevis Fraunhofer (MV), Sunnybrook Health Sciences (SY), Harvard/Boston University (HB), Yale School of Medicine (YL), King's College London (KCL) and Utah CARMA (UTA, UTB). There were 8 different algorithms evaluated in this study. RESULTS Some algorithms were able to perform significantly better than SD and FWHM methods in both pre- and post-ablation imaging. Segmentation in pre-ablation images was challenging and good correlation with the reference standard was found in post-ablation images. Overlap scores (out of 100) with the reference standard were as follows: Pre: IC = 37, MV = 22, SY = 17, YL = 48, KCL = 30, UTA = 42, UTB = 45; Post: IC = 76, MV = 85, SY = 73, HB = 76, YL = 84, KCL = 78, UTA = 78, UTB = 72. CONCLUSIONS The study concludes that currently no algorithm is deemed clearly better than others. There is scope for further algorithmic developments in LA fibrosis and scar quantification from LGE CMR images. Benchmarking of future scar segmentation algorithms is thus important. The proposed benchmarking framework is made available as open-source and new participants can evaluate their algorithms via a web-based interface.},

abstract = {The identification of the molecular mechanisms controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation during the embryonic, fetal, and early neonatal life appears of paramount interest in regard to exploiting this information to promote cardiac regeneration. Here, we show that the proliferative potential of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes is powerfully stimulated by the sustained activation of the Notch pathway. We found that Notch1 is expressed in proliferating ventricular immature cardiac myocytes (ICMs) both in vitro and in vivo, and that the number of Notch1-positive cells in the heart declines with age. Notch1 expression in ICMs paralleled the expression of its Jagged1 ligand on non-myocyte supporting cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling in ICMs blocked their proliferation and induced apoptosis; in contrast, its activation by Jagged1 or by the constitutive expression of its activated form using an adeno-associated virus markedly stimulated proliferative signaling and promoted ICM expansion. Maintenance or reactivation of Notch signaling in cardiac myocytes might represent an interesting target for innovative regenerative therapy.},

Additional information on the use of the first- and second-generation left ventricular assist devices has come from a recently released report spanning the years 2006 to 2009, from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support, a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institutesponsored collaboration between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the scientific community.

abstract = {The aims of the study were to determine how aggregates of intrinsic cardiac (IC) neurons transduce the cardiovascular milieu versus responding to changes in central neuronal drive and to determine IC network interactions subsequent to induced neural imbalances in the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Activity from multiple IC neurons in the right atrial ganglionated plexus was recorded in eight anaesthetized canines using a 16-channel linear microelectrode array. Induced changes in IC neuronal activity were evaluated in response to: (1) focal cardiac mechanical distortion; (2) electrical activation of cervical vagi or stellate ganglia; (3) occlusion of the inferior vena cava or thoracic aorta; (4) transient ventricular ischaemia, and (5) neurally induced AF. Low level activity (ranging from 0 to 2.7 Hz) generated by 92 neurons was identified in basal states, activities that displayed functional interconnectivity. The majority (56{\%}) of IC neurons so identified received indirect central inputs (vagus alone: 25{\%}; stellate ganglion alone: 27{\%}; both: 48{\%}). Fifty per cent transduced the cardiac milieu responding to multimodal stressors applied to the great vessels or heart. Fifty per cent of IC neurons exhibited cardiac cycle periodicity, with activity occurring primarily in late diastole into isovolumetric contraction. Cardiac-related activity in IC neurons was primarily related to direct cardiac mechano-sensory inputs and indirect autonomic efferent inputs. In response to mediastinal nerve stimulation, most IC neurons became excessively activated; such network behaviour preceded and persisted throughout AF. It was concluded that stochastic interactions occur among IC local circuit neuronal populations in the control of regional cardiac function. Modulation of IC local circuit neuronal recruitment may represent a novel approach for the treatment of cardiac disease, including atrial arrhythmias.},

The interpretation of activation wavefronts and their propagation can identify mechanistic properties of a broad range of electrophysiological pathologies. However, the sparsity, distribution and uncertainty of recorded data make accurate conduction velocity calculation difficult. A wide range of mathematical approaches have been proposed for addressing this challenge, often targeted towards specific data modalities, species or recording environments. Many of these algorithms require identification of activation times from electrogram recordings which themselves may have complex morphology or low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper surveys algorithms designed for identifying local activation times and computing conduction direction and speed. Their suitability for use in different recording contexts and applications is assessed.},

@article{Kikuchi2010,
abstract = {Recent studies indicate that mammals, including humans, maintain some capacity to renew cardiomyocytes throughout postnatal life. Yet, there is little or no significant cardiac muscle regeneration after an injury such as acute myocardial infarction. By contrast, zebrafish efficiently regenerate lost cardiac muscle, providing a model for understanding how natural heart regeneration may be blocked or enhanced. In the absence of lineage-tracing technology applicable to adult zebrafish, the cellular origins of newly regenerated cardiac muscle have remained unclear. Using new genetic fate-mapping approaches, here we identify a population of cardiomyocytes that become activated after resection of the ventricular apex and contribute prominently to cardiac muscle regeneration. Through the use of a transgenic reporter strain, we found that cardiomyocytes throughout the subepicardial ventricular layer trigger expression of the embryonic cardiogenesis gene gata4 within a week of trauma, before expression localizes to proliferating cardiomyocytes surrounding and within the injury site. Cre-recombinase-based lineage-tracing of cells expressing gata4 before evident regeneration, or of cells expressing the contractile gene cmlc2 before injury, each labelled most cardiac muscle in the ensuing regenerate. By optical voltage mapping of surface myocardium in whole ventricles, we found that electrical conduction is re-established between existing and regenerated cardiomyocytes between 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. After injury and prolonged fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition to arrest cardiac regeneration and enable scar formation, experimental release of the signalling block led to gata4 expression and morphological improvement of the injured ventricular wall without loss of scar tissue. Our results indicate that electrically coupled cardiac muscle regenerates after resection injury, primarily through activation and expansion of cardiomyocyte populations. These findings have implications for promoting regeneration of the injured human heart.},

abstract = {A new method is proposed for geostatistical simulation and reconstruction of porous media by integrating hard (quantitative) and soft (qualitative) data with a newly developed method of reconstruction. The reconstruction method is based on a cross-correlation function that we recently proposed and contains global multiple-point information about the porous medium under study, which is referred to cross-correlation-based simulation (CCSIM). The porous medium to be reconstructed is represented by a reference image (RI). Some of the information contained in the RI is represented by a training image (TI). In unconditional simulation, only the TI is used to reconstruct the RI, without honoring any particular data. If some soft data, such as a seismic image, and hard data are also available, they are integrated with the TI and conditional CCSIM method in order to reconstruct the RI, by honoring the hard data exactly. To illustrate the method, several two- and three-dimensional porous media are simulated and reconstructed, and the results are compared with those provided by the RI, as well as those generated by the traditional two-point geostatistical simulation, namely the co-sequential Gaussian simulation. To quantify the accuracy of the simulations and reconstruction, several statistical properties of the porous media, such as their porosity distribution, variograms, and long-range connectivity, as well as two-phase flow of oil and water through them, are computed. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between the results computed with the simulated model and those obtained with the RI.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: In acute ascent to altitude, untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is often replaced with central sleep apnea (CSA). In patients with obstructive sleep apnea who travel to altitude, it is unknown whether their home positive airway pressure (PAP) settings are sufficient to treat their obstructive sleep apnea, or altitude-associated central sleep apnea.

METHODS: Ten participants with positive airway pressure-treated obstructive sleep apnea, who reside at 1,320 m altitude, underwent polysomnography on their home positive airway pressure settings at 1,320 m and at a simulated altitude of 2,750 m in a hypobaric chamber. Six of the participants were subsequently studied without positive airway pressure at 2,750 m.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 1,320 m, all participants' sleep apnea was controlled with positive airway pressure on home settings; at 2,750, no participants' sleep apnea was controlled. At higher altitude, the apnea-hypopnea index was higher (11 vs. 2 events/h; P {\textless} 0.01), mostly due to hypopneas (10.5 vs. 2 events/h; P {\textless} 0.01). Mean oxygen saturations were lower (88 vs. 93{\%}; P {\textless} 0.01) and total sleep time was diminished (349 vs. 393 min; P = 0.03). Four of six participants without positive airway pressure at 2,750 m required supplemental oxygen to prevent sustained oxygen saturation (as determined by pulse oximetry) less than 80{\%}. Positive airway pressure also was associated with reduced central sleep apnea (0 vs. 1; P = 0.03), improved sleep time (358 vs. 292 min; P = 0.06), and improved sleep efficiency (78 vs. 63{\%}; P = 0.04).

CONCLUSIONS: Acute altitude exposure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea treated with positive airway pressure is associated with hypoxemia, decreased sleep time, and increased frequency of hypopneas compared with baseline altitude. Application of positive airway pressure at altitude is associated with decreased central sleep apnea and increased sleep efficiency.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the cellular implementation of systems-level neural processes like action, thought and emotion has been limited by the availability of tools to interrogate specific classes of neural cells within intact, living brain tissue. Here we identify and develop an archaeal light-driven chloride pump (NpHR) from Natronomonas pharaonis for temporally precise optical inhibition of neural activity. NpHR allows either knockout of single action potentials, or sustained blockade of spiking. NpHR is compatible with ChR2, the previous optical excitation technology we have described, in that the two opposing probes operate at similar light powers but with well-separated action spectra. NpHR, like ChR2, functions in mammals without exogenous cofactors, and the two probes can be integrated with calcium imaging in mammalian brain tissue for bidirectional optical modulation and readout of neural activity. Likewise, NpHR and ChR2 can be targeted together to Caenorhabditis elegans muscle and cholinergic motor neurons to control locomotion bidirectionally. NpHR and ChR2 form a complete system for multimodal, high-speed, genetically targeted, all-optical interrogation of living neural circuits.},

abstract = {AIM To describe the electrocardiographic (ECG) phenomena characterized by T-wave inversion in the precordial leads in adults and to highlight its differential diagnosis. METHODS A retrospective chart review of 8 adult patients who were admitted with ECG T-wave inversion in the anterior chest leads with or without prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval. They had different clinical conditions. Each patient underwent appropriate clinical assessment including investigation for myocardial involvement. Single and multimodality non-invasive, semi-invasive and invasive diagnostic approach were used to ascertain the diagnosis. The diagnostic assessment included biochemical investigation, cardiac and abdominal ultrasound, cerebral and chest computed tomography, nuclear medicine and coronary angiography. RESULTS Eight adult subjects (5 females) with a mean age of 66 years (range 51 to 82) are analyzed. The etiology of T-wave inversion in the precordial leads were diverse. On admission, all patients had normal blood pressure and the ECG showed sinus rhythm. Five patients showed marked prolongation of the QTc interval. The longest QTc interval (639 ms) was found in the patient with pheochromocytoma. Giant T-wave inversion (≥ 10 mm) was found in pheochromocytoma followed by electroconvulsive therapy and finally ischemic heart disease. The deepest T-wave was measured in lead V3 (5 ×). In 3 patients presented with mild T-wave inversion (patients 1, 5 and 4 mm), the QTc interval was not prolonged (432, 409 and 424 msec), respectively. CONCLUSION T-wave inversion associated with or without QTc prolongation requires meticulous history taking, physical examination and tailored diagnostic modalities to reach rapid and correct diagnosis to establish appropriate therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Sympathetic innervation of the normal and acutely ischemic myocardium and the effects of regional myocardial sympathetic denervation of the ischemic area on the evolving electrical changes during coronary occlusion were assessed in pigs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. The histofluorescence of the adrenergic nerve fibers (glyoxylic acid reaction), which in the normal myocardium were distributed in a diffuse network, decreased slightly after 45 min of occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and nearly disappeared after 2 h of ischemia. Topical application of phenol (carbolic acid, 88{\%}) to the coronary arterial wall produced a transmural loss of catecholamine histofluorescence in the distal myocardium supplied by the phenol-treated arterial segment. Mapping of the epicardial direct current (DC) electrograms in sympathetically denervated and in nondenervated sections of the same ischemic area, using three rows of seven cotton-wick electrodes, was performed in eight pigs and validated in eight other nondenervated pigs. During 45 min of LAD occlusion, the denervated area, with respect to the nondenervated region, showed a greater decline in T-Q segment depression after 20 min of ischemia (P less than 0.0001), a lesser degree of S-T segment elevation throughout the study (P less than 0.0001), a delayed development of monophasic potentials (P less than 0.05), a minor degree of S-T segment alternans (P less than 0.0001), and a less marked, but still present, period of transient electrical recovery. Thus acute regional myocardial sympathectomy reduces the magnitude of the local electrical manifestations of acute myocardial ischemia in the in situ pig heart. Also in this model, sympathetic fibers appeared to lose the catecholamine histofluorescence after 2 h of acute ischemia.},

abstract = {Gradients of signalling and transcription factors govern many aspects of embryogenesis, highlighting the need for spatiotemporal control of regulatory protein levels. MicroRNAs are phylogenetically conserved small RNAs that regulate the translation of target messenger RNAs, providing a mechanism for protein dose regulation. Here we show that microRNA-1-1 (miR-1-1) and miR-1-2 are specifically expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle precursor cells. We found that the miR-1 genes are direct transcriptional targets of muscle differentiation regulators including serum response factor, MyoD and Mef2. Correspondingly, excess miR-1 in the developing heart leads to a decreased pool of proliferating ventricular cardiomyocytes. Using a new algorithm for microRNA target identification that incorporates features of RNA structure and target accessibility, we show that Hand2, a transcription factor that promotes ventricular cardiomyocyte expansion, is a target of miR-1. This work suggests that miR-1 genes titrate the effects of critical cardiac regulatory proteins to control the balance between differentiation and proliferation during cardiogenesis.},

abstract = {Abstract  Early changes in branching geometry of microvasculature and its associated impact on the perfusion distribution in diseases, especially those in which different branching generations are affected differently, require the ability to analyze intact vascular trees over a wide range of scales. Micro-CT offers an excellent framework to analyze the microvascular branching geometry. Such an analysis requires methods to be developed that can accurately characterize branching properties, such as branch diameter, length, branching angle, and branch interconnectivity of the microvasculature. The purpose of this article is to report the results of a study of two human intramyocardial coronary vascular tree casts in which the accuracy of micro-CT vascular imaging and its analysis are tested against measurements made through an optical microscope (used as the ``gold-standard''). Methods related to image segmentation of the vascular lumen, vessel tree centerline extraction, individual branch segment measurement, and compensating for the non-ideal modulation transfer function of micro-CT scanners are presented. The extracted centerline accurately characterized the hierarchical structure of the vascular tree casts in terms of ``parent--branch'' relationships which allowed each interbranch segments' dimensions to be compared to the optical measurement method. The comparison results show a close to ideal 1:1 relationship for both length and diameter measurements made by the two methods. Combining the results from both specimens, the standard deviation of the difference between measurement methods was 19 $\mu$m for the measurement of interbranch segment diameters (ranging from 12 to 769 $\mu$m), and 172 $\mu$m for the measurement of interbranch segment lengths (ranging from 14 to 3252 $\mu$m). These results suggest that our micro-CT image analysis method can be used to characterize a vascular tree's hierarchical structure, and accurately measure interbranch segment lengths and diameters.},

abstract = {Extracellular and intracellular longitudinal resistances (ro and ri), transmembrane potentials, and conduction velocity were determined in arterially blood-perfused rabbit papillary muscles. Cable analysis was made possible by placing the muscle in a H2O-saturated gaseous environment, which acted as an electrical insulator. Ischemia was produced by exchanging the O2 in the atmosphere by N2 (94{\%} N2-6{\%} CO2) in addition to arresting coronary flow. The first 10-15 minutes of ischemia were characterized by an increase in ro, while ri remained constant. The early part of the increase in ro coincided with the drop in perfusion pressure and was probably due to the diminution of intravascular volume. Rapid electrical uncoupling, reflected by an increase in ri (threefold within 5 minutes), occurred thereafter. The dissociation between the early increase in ro and the delayed increase in ri produced an initial increase in the ratio ro:ri, which subsequently decreased. The decrease in conduction velocity was less than observed in intact hearts with ischemia. This difference is explained by the relatively small changes in resting membrane potential and action potential amplitude in the preparation used. Our results suggest that in the early, reversible phase of ischemia, the increase in ro contributes to a small but significant extent to the slowing of conduction. After 15-20 minutes, the rapid cellular uncoupling, which was most likely coincident with breakdown of cellular homeostasis, may contribute to the occurrence of arrhythmias during this phase of ischemia. Moreover, the early change in the ratio ro:ri will influence the amplitude of the extracellular electrograms following coronary occlusion (TQ-segment and ST-segment shifts).},

abstract = {Afferent and efferent cardiac neurotransmission via the cardiac nerves intricately modulates nearly all physiological functions of the heart (chronotropy, dromotropy, lusitropy, and inotropy). Afferent information from the heart is transmitted to higher levels of the nervous system for processing (intrinsic cardiac nervous system, extracardiac-intrathoracic ganglia, spinal cord, brain stem, and higher centers), which ultimately results in efferent cardiomotor neural impulses (via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves). This system forms interacting feedback loops that provide physiological stability for maintaining normal rhythm and life-sustaining circulation. This system also ensures that there is fine-tuned regulation of sympathetic–parasympathetic balance in the heart under normal and stressed states in the short (beat to beat), intermediate (minutes to hours), and long term (days to years). This important neurovisceral/autonomic nervous system also plays a major role in the pathophysiology and progression of heart disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Transdifferentiation of neurons in heart failure, functional denervation, cardiac and extracardiac neural remodeling has also been identified and characterized during the progression of disease. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular processes governing innervation and the functional control of the myocardium in health and disease provide a rational mechanistic basis for the development of neuraxial therapies for preventing sudden cardiac death and other arrhythmias. Advances in cellular, molecular, and bioengineering realms have underscored the emergence of this area as an important avenue of scientific inquiry and therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {Introduction Myocardial ischemia is a pathological condition initiated by supply and demand imbalance of the blood to the heart. Previous studies suggest that ischemia originates in the subendocardium, i.e., that nontransmural ischemia is limited to the subendocardium. By contrast, we hypothesized that acute myocardial ischemia is not limited to the subendocardium and sought to document its spatial distribution in an animal preparation. The goal of these experiments was to investigate the spatial organization of ischemia and its relationship to the resulting shifts in ST segment potentials during short episodes of acute ischemia. Methods We conducted acute ischemia studies in open-chest canines (N = 19) and swines (N = 10), which entailed creating carefully controlled ischemia using demand, supply or complete occlusion ischemia protocols and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. Elevation of the potentials at 40{\%} of the ST segment between the J-point and the peak of the T-wave (ST40{\%}) provided the metric for local ischemia. The threshold for ischemic ST segment elevations was defined as two standard deviations away from the baseline values. Results The relative frequency of occurrence of acute ischemia was higher in the subendocardium (78{\%} for canines and 94{\%} for swines) and the mid-wall (87{\%} for canines and 97{\%} for swines) in comparison with the subepicardium (30{\%} for canines and 22{\%} for swines). In addition, acute ischemia was seen arising throughout the myocardium (distributed pattern) in 87{\%} of the canine and 94{\%} of the swine episodes. Alternately, acute ischemia was seen originating only in the subendocardium (subendocardial pattern) in 13{\%} of the canine episodes and 6{\%} of the swine episodes (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the spatial distribution of acute ischemia is a complex phenomenon arising throughout the myocardial wall and is not limited to the subendocardium.},

abstract = {Background: Atrial tachycardia and fibrillation in humans may be partly consequent to vagal stimulation. Induction of fibrillation in the small heart is considered to be impossible due to lack of a critical mass of {\textgreater}100-200 mm2. Even with the recent progression of the technology of in vivo and in vitro mouse electrophysiological studies, few reports describe atrial tachycardia or fibrillation in mice. The purpose of this study was to attempt provocation of atrial tachyarrhythmia in mice using transvenous pacing following cholinergic stimulation. Methods and results: In vivo electrophysiology studies were performed in 14 normal mice. A six-lead ECG was recorded from surface limb leads, and an octapolar electrode catheter was inserted via jugular vein cutdown approach for simultaneous atrial and ventricular endocardial recording and pacing. Atrial tachycardia and fibrillation were inducible in one mouse at baseline electrophysiology study and eleven of fourteen mice after carbamyl choline injection. The mean duration of atrial tachycardia was 126{\{}+/-{\}}384 s. The longest episode lasted 35 min and only terminated after atropine injection. Reinduction of atrial tachycardia after administration of atropine was not possible. Conclusion: Despite the small mass of the normal mouse atria, sustained atrial tachycardia and fibrillation can be easily and reproducibly inducible with endocardial pacing after cholinergic agonist administration. This finding may contribute to our understanding of the classical theories of arrhythmogenesis and critical substrates necessary for sustaining microreentrant circuits. The techniques of transcatheter parasympathetic agonist-mediated atrial tachycardia induction may be valuable in further murine electrophysiological studies, especially mutant models with potential atrial arrhythmia phenotypes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ischemia of the myocardium surviving an infarction induces ST segment elevation in infarct-related ECG leads. In cases with no viable tissues, ischemia adjacent to the infarction could induce a similar ECG pattern if there is ST segment potential transmission through the necrotic scar. We analyzed whether acute ischemia adjacent to a healed infarction with no viable tissue may induce ST segment elevation on the surface of the necrotic scar. METHODS AND RESULTS: Epicardial ST segment changes elicited during 30 minutes of acute reocclusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery 2 cm above the first diagonal branch were analyzed by 32-channel mapping in 18 chloralose-anesthetized open-chest pigs with 1-month-old anterior infarctions induced by permanent ligature below the first diagonal branch (group 1). The effect of a previous infarction on the magnitude of ischemic ST segment changes was assessed by similar mapping in 21 control pigs submitted to a LAD ligature 2 cm above the first diagonal branch (group 2, n = 11) or just below this branch (group 3, n = 10). Myocardial perfusion after coronary ligature was estimated in 7 pigs with chronic infarction and in 3 control pigs by mapping of myocardial technetium-99m-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) activity in transmural samples underlying each epicardial electrode. The width of cell layers surviving the infarction was measured and their viability after 60 minutes of coronary reocclusion was assessed by intracellular glycogen staining. Reocclusion of the LAD induced parallel ST segment elevation at the periinfarction zone and at the necrotic scar, although in the latter region the changes were less marked (maximal ST segment, 8.4 +/- 3.0 mV versus 2.7 +/- 1.8 mV, ANOVA, P {\textless} .001). ST segment elevation inside the scar was greater at the margins (3.9 +/- 1.8 mV) than at sites 20 mm toward the center (2.8 +/- 1.7 mV, P = .003). The necrotic area was virtually devoid of surviving cells except for a 0.22 +/- 0.04-mm-wide subendocardial band that continued to show a positive intracellular glycogen reaction after the second LAD ligature. Acute ischemia adjacent to the infarction (group 1) induced lower ST segment elevation than acute ischemia at a comparable cardiac region in noninfarcted pigs (group 2) (ANOVA, P = .02), despite the fact that these areas developed similar underperfusion after coronary occlusion (percent MIBI activity of that in normal myocardium, 7 +/- 8 versus 7 +/- 6, P = NS). ST segment changes in group 2 pigs were comparable to those induced in group 3 pigs with a 2-cm-lower coronary occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ischemia adjacent to a chronic infarction induces ST segment elevation at the surface of the scar despite the virtual absence of viable tissue within the infarction. Data suggest a passive ST segment potential transmission through the infarction. Moreover, ischemia adjacent to a chronic infarction induces lower ST segment elevation than ischemia not adjacent to a necrosis. The mechanisms accounting for these regional differences are probably independent of collateral myocardial perfusion and ischemia extension.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myocardial ischemia increases tissue electrical resistivity leading to cell-to-cell uncoupling, and this effect is delayed by ischemic preconditioning in isolated myocardium. Alterations in myocardial resistivity elicited by ischemia in vivo may influence arrhythmogenesis and local ST-segment changes, but this is not well known. METHODS AND RESULTS: Myocardial impedance (resistivity [omega x cm] and phase angle [degrees]), epicardial ST segment, and ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed during 4 hours of coronary artery occlusion in 11 anesthetized open-chest pigs; these were compared with 13 other pigs submitted to a similar coronary occlusion preceded by ischemic preconditioning. Myocardial resistivity rose slowly during the first 34+/-7 minutes of occlusion (237+/-41 to 359+/-59 omega x cm), increased rapidly to 488+/-100 omega x cm at 60 minutes, and reached a plateau value (718+/-266 omega x cm, ANOVA; P{\textless}.01) at 150+/-69 minutes. By contrast, phase-angle changes began after 17 minutes of ischemia (-3.0+/-1.6 degrees to -4.2+/-1.2 degrees at 29+/-8 minutes) and evolved faster thereafter (-12.5+/-5.3 degrees at 144+/-56 minutes). Marked changes in myocardial impedance were observed during the reversion of ST-segment elevation that occurred 1 to 4 hours after occlusion, but impedance changes were less apparent during the early ST-segment recovery seen at 15 to 35 minutes of ischemia. The second arrhythmia peak (30+/-5 minutes) coincided with the fast change in tissue impedance, and both were delayed (P{\textless}.05) by ischemic preconditioning. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid impairment of myocardial impedance occurs after 30 minutes of coronary occlusion, and its onset is better defined by shift in phase angle than by rise in tissue resistivity. Phase 1b arrhythmias are associated with marked impedance changes, and both are delayed by preconditioning. Reversion of ST-segment elevation is partially associated with impairment of myocardial impedance, but other factors play a role as well.},

@article{Xie2010,
abstract = {How early (EADs) and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) overcome electrotonic source-sink mismatches in tissue to trigger premature ventricular complexes remains incompletely understood. To study this question, we used a rabbit ventricular action potential model to simulate tissues in which a central area of contiguous myocytes susceptible to EADs or DADs was surrounded by unsusceptible tissue. In 1D tissue with normal longitudinal conduction velocity (0.55 m/s), the numbers of contiguous susceptible myocytes required for an EAD and a barely suprathreshold DAD to trigger a propagating action potential were 70 and 80, respectively. In 2D tissue, these numbers increased to 6940 and 7854, and in 3D tissue to 696,910 and 817,280. These numbers were significantly decreased by reduced gap junction conductance, simulated fibrosis, reduced repolarization reserve and heart failure electrical remodeling. In conclusion, the source-sink mismatch in well-coupled cardiac tissue powerfully protects the heart from arrhythmias due to sporadic afterdepolarizations. Structural and electrophysiological remodeling decrease these numbers significantly but still require synchronization mechanisms for EADs and DADs to overcome the robust protective effects of source-sink mismatch.},

abstract = {Background Neuromodulation of the paravertebral ganglia by using symmetric voltage controlled kilohertz frequency alternating current (KHFAC) has the potential to be a reversible alternative to surgical intervention in patients with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. KHFAC creates scalable focal inhibition of action potential conduction. Objective The purpose of this article was to evaluate the efficacy of KHFAC when applied to the T1-T2 paravertebral chain to mitigate sympathetic outflow to the heart. Methods In anesthetized, vagotomized, porcine subjects, the heart was exposed via a midline sternotomy along with paravertebral chain ganglia. The T3 paravertebral ganglion was electrically stimulated, and activation recovery intervals (ARIs) were obtained from a 56-electrode sock placed over both ventricles. A bipolar Ag electrode was wrapped around the paravertebral chain between T1 and T2 and connected to a symmetric voltage controlled KHFAC generator. A comparison of cardiac indices during T3 stimulation conditions, with and without KHFAC, provided a measure of block efficacy. Results Right-sided T3 stimulation (at 4 Hz) was titrated to produce reproducible ARI changes from baseline (52 ± 30 ms). KHFAC resulted in a 67{\%} mitigation of T3 electrical stimulation effects on ARI (18.5 ± 22 ms; P {\textless}.005). T3 stimulation repeated after KHFAC produced equivalent ARI changes as control. KHFAC evoked a transient functional sympathoexcitation at onset that was inversely related to frequency and directly related to intensity. The optimum block threshold was 15 kHz and 15 V. Conclusion KHFAC applied to nexus (convergence) points of the cardiac nervous system produces a graded and reversible block of underlying axons. As such, KHFAC has the therapeutic potential for on-demand and reversible mitigation of sympathoexcitation.},

abstract = {Myocardial electrical impedance is influenced by the mechanical activity of the heart. Therefore, the ischemia induced mechanical dysfunction may cause specific changes in the systolic-diastolic pattern of myocardial impedance but this is not known. This study aimed to analyze the phasic changes of myocardial resistivity in normal and ischemic conditions. Myocardial resistivity was measured continuously during the cardiac cycle using 26 different simultaneous excitation frequencies (1 kHz-1 MHz) in 7 anesthetized open chest pigs. Animals were submitted to 30 minutes regional ischemia by acute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. The electrocardiogram, left ventricular (LV) pressure, LV dP/dt and aortic blood flow were recorded simultaneously. Baseline myocardial resistivity depicted a phasic pattern during the cardiac cycle with higher values at the pre-ejection period (4.19±1.09{\%} increase above the mean,p{\textless}0.001) and lower values during relaxation phase (5.01±0.85{\%} below the mean,p{\textless}0.001). Acute coronary occlusion induced two effects on the phasic resistivity curve: 1) a prompt (5 min ischemia) holosystolic resistivity rise leading to a bell-shaped waveform and to a reduction of the area under the LV pressure-impedance curve (1427±335 $\Omega$•cm•mmHg vs 757±266 $\Omega$•cm•mmHg,p{\textless}0.01,41 kHz) and 2) a subsequent (5-10 min ischemia) progressive mean resistivity rise (325±23 $\Omega$•cm vs 438±37 $\Omega$•cm at 30 min,p{\textless}0.01,1 kHz). The structural and mechanical myocardial dysfunction induced by acute coronary occlusion can be recognized by specific changes in the systolic-diastolic myocardial resistivity curve. Therefore these changes may become a new indicator (surrogate) of evolving acute myocadial ischemia.},

abstract = {Mild-to-moderate ischemia does not result in ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), but rather non-specific changes in the T wave, which are frequently la-beled as non-diagnostic for ischemia. Robust methods to quantify such T wave heterogeneity can have immediate clin-ical applications. We sought to evaluate the effects of sponta-neous ischemia on the evolution of spatial T wave changes, based on the eigenvalues of the spatial correlation matrix of the ECG, in patients undergoing nuclear cardiac imaging for evaluating intermittent chest pain. We computed T wave com-plexity (TWC), the ratio of the second to the first eigenvalue of repolarization, from 5-min baseline and 5-min peak-stress Holter ECG recordings. Our sample included 30 males and 20 females aged 63 ± 11 years. Compared to baseline, significant changes in TWC were only seen in patients with ischemia (n = 10) during stress testing, but not among others. The absolute changes in TWC were significantly larger in the is-chemia group compared to others, with a pattern that seemed to depend on the severity or anatomic distribution of ischemia. Our results demonstrate that ischemia-induced changes in T wave morphology can be meaningfully quantified from the surface 12-lead ECG, suggesting an important opportunity for improving diagnostics in patients with chest pain.},

abstract = {Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is being increasingly used as a blood marker of acute or ongoing cardiac injury in various laboratory animals although the range of species in which it is applicable and its tissue selectivity has not been demonstrated. To address this concern, cardiac and skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from various species were homogenised and diluted, and their reactivity was then determined in the first- and second-generation immunoassays for cTnT. Cardiac tissue reactivity was found for all species studies, being highest for rats and several-fold lower for chickens and fish, and intermediate for dogs, pigs, goats, cows, sheep, horses, rabbits, and turkeys. Skeletal muscle had 10 per cent of the reactivity of cardiac muscle in the first-generation assay and 1 per cent of the reactivity of cardiac muscle in the second-generation assay. In the absence of moderate to marked skeletal muscle injury, the second-generation cTnT immunoassay has sufficient reactivity and tissue-selectivity to serve as a blood test for the discrimination between cardiac and skeletal muscle injury in a wide range of species.},

abstract = {We examined the relative roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in mediating the alpha1-adrenergic receptor (alpha1-AR) stimulated hypertrophic phenotype in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM). Norepinephrine (NE; 1 microM) in the presence of the beta -AR antagonist propranolol (Pro; 2 microM) caused activation of Ras ({\textgreater}six-fold), MAPK/ERK kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2, {\textgreater}10-fold) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, approximately 30-fold) within 5 min, as determined by kinase activity assays and Western blots using phospho-specific antibodies. Conversely, p38 and c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) were not activated by NE/Pro. Activated MEK1/2 signals remained detectable at 2 h, and activated ERK1/2 remained detectable at 48 h. The alpha1-AR selective inhibitor prazosin (100 nM) completely inhibited the NE/Pro-stimulated activation of Ras, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of NE/Pro-stimulated protein synthesis (as assessed by [3H]leucine incorporation and cellular protein accumulation) and ERK1/2 activation, with approximately 50{\%} inhibition at a concentration between 10 and 50 microM, which is consistent with the known IC50 values of PD98059 for MEK1 (4 microM) and MEK2 (50 microM). Thus, these data show that alpha1-AR stimulated hypertrophy in ARVM is dependent on the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.},

The goal of this study is to determine whether this activity propagates to or occurs in the proximal specialized conduction system during VF as well.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: An 8×8 array with 300 µm spaced electrodes was placed over the His bundles of isolated, perfused rabbit hearts (n = 12). Ventricular myocardial (VM) and His activations were differentiated by calculating Laplacian recordings from unipolar signals. Activation rates of the VM and His bundle were compared and the His bundle conduction velocity was measured during perfused VF followed by 8 minutes of unperfused VF. During perfused VF the average VM activation rate of 11.04 activations/sec was significantly higher than the His bundle activation rate of 6.88 activations/sec (p{\textless}0.05). However from 3-8 minutes of unperfused VF the His system activation rate (6.16, 5.53, 5.14, 5.22, 6.00, and 4.62 activations/sec significantly faster than the rate of the VM (4.67, 3.63, 2.94, 2.24, 3.45, and 2.31 activations/sec) (p{\textless}0.05). The conduction velocity of the His system immediately decreased to 94{\%} of the sinus rate during perfused VF then gradually decreased to 67{\%} of sinus rhythm conduction at 8 minutes of unperfused VF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: During prolonged VF the activation rate of the His bundle is faster than that of the VM. This suggests that the proximal conduction system, like the distal Purkinje system, may be an important driver during long duration VF and may be a target for interventional therapy.},

abstract = {Early identification of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is necessary to initiate appropriate treatment. In patients presenting without ST-segment elevation, diagnosis is often dependent on the presence of elevated myocardial markers. This study examines the ability of serial MB mass alone and in combination with myoglobin in diagnosing AMI in patients without ST-segment elevation within 3 hours of presentation. In all, 2,093 patients were admitted and underwent serial marker analysis using myoglobin, creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB at 0, 3, 6, and 8 hours. AMI was diagnosed by a CK-MB ≥8.0 ng/ml and a relative index (RI) (CK-MB × 100/total CK) ≥4.0. A total of 186 patients (9{\%}) were diagnosed with AMI. The optimal diagnostic strategy was an elevated CK-MB + RI on the initial or 3-hour sample or at least a twofold increase in CK-MB without exceeding the upper range of normal over the 3-hour time period (sensitivity 93{\%}, specificity 98{\%}). The combination of an elevated CK-MB + RI or myoglobin on the initial or 3-hour sample had a sensitivity of 94{\%}, although specificity was significantly lower, at 86{\%}. Sensitivities and specificities after exclusion of the 242 patients with ischemic electrocardiographic changes were essentially unchanged. We conclude that most patients with AMI presenting with nondiagnostic electrocadiograms can be diagnosed within 3 hours of presentation.},

The relative ability for each of the described techniques varies, and the optimal way to combine and use these techniques in clinical practice remains unclear. Low LVEF, which is the most widely used test on which ICD intervention is recommended, does not have a particularly high discriminatory ability to identify SCD rather than non-SCD mortality. Although data exist supporting the concept that noninvasive risk stratification techniques may be useful to identify patients with low LVEF who are at low risk for SCD, this requires further testing. There are also data to support the concept that noninvasive risk stratification techniques may be useful to identify patients who do not have low LVEF who nevertheless are at substantial risk for SCD. Because most SCD occurs in this latter group, substantial effort is justified in evaluating, testing, and ultimately implementing risk stratification strategies in this group. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Heart Association, Inc, the American College of Cardiology Foundation, and the Heart Rhythm Society.},

Given the large scale of the nonlinear system involved, questions were recently raised regarding reproducibility, numerical stability, and uniqueness of model solutions, as well as ability of the model to simulate AP propagation in multicellular configurations. To address these issues, we reexamined ventricular models of myocyte AP developed in our laboratory with the following results. 1), Recognizing that the model involves a system of differential-algebraic equations, a procedure is developed for estimating consistent initial conditions that insure uniqueness and stability of the solution. 2), Model parameters that can be used to modify these initial conditions according to experimental values are identified. 3), A convergence criterion for steady-state solution is defined based on tracking the incremental contribution of each ion species to the membrane voltage. 4), Singularities in state variable formulations are removed analytically. 5), A biphasic current stimulus is implemented to completely eliminate stimulus artifact during long-term pacing over a broad range of frequencies. 6), Using the AP computed based on 1-5 above, an efficient scheme is developed for computing propagation in multicellular models. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Biophysical Society.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These samples were also analysed by immunoblotting for cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT). The content of cTnI and cTnT in skeletal muscle was below 0.6{\%} of that found in heart for all animal species studied. This low immunoreactivity in skeletal muscle was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The content of CK was higher in skeletal muscle than in heart muscle for all species. The CK-MB/total CK ratio was lower in skeletal muscle than in cardiac muscle for all species. The differences in CK-MB content of skeletal muscle and heart muscle were much less pronounced than the tissue differences in the amounts of the cardiac troponins. The cardiac troponins are potentially useful serum markers of myocardial damage, with high specificity for myocardial muscle in these common laboratory animals. Creatine kinase-MB is much less cardiac-specific. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Published studies show that ventricular pacing in canine hearts produces three distinct patterns of epicardial excitation: elliptical isochrones near an epicardial pacing site, with asymmetric bulges; areas with high propagation velocity, up to 2 or 3 m/s and numerous breakthrough sites; and lower velocity areas ({\textless}1 m/s), where excitation moves across the epicardial projection of the septum. With increasing pacing depth, the magnitude of epicardial potential maxima becomes asymmetric. The electrophysiological mechanisms that generate the distinct patterns have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated those mechanisms experimentally. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, epicardial and intramural excitation isochrone and potential maps have been recorded from 22 exposed or isolated dog hearts, by means of epicardial electrode arrays and transmural plunge electrodes. In five experiments, a ventricular cavity was perfused with diluted Lugol solution. The epicardial bulges result from electrotonic attraction from the helically shaped subepicardial portions of the wave front. The high-velocity patterns and the associated multiple breakthroughs are due to involvement of the Purkinje network. The low velocity at the septum crossing is due to the missing Purkinje involvement in that area. The asymmetric magnitude of the epicardial potential maxima and the shift of the breakthrough sites provoked by deep stimulation are a consequence of the epi-endocardial obliqueness of the intramural fibers. These results improve our understanding of intramural and epicardial propagation during premature ventricular contractions and paced beats. This can be useful for interpreting epicardial maps recorded at surgery or inversely computed from body surface ECGs.},

abstract = {Epicardial and body surface QRS-T wave potential distributions were measured during normal and ectopic sequences in intact chimpanzees. Epicardial potential distributions were used because they provide a comprehensive picture of total cardiac electrical activity for relating heart and body surface events during both ventricular activation and repolarization. When the epicardial potential gradients existed over a distance greater than that to the recording points on the body surface, e.g., as occurred during the overlap of terminal ventricular activation and early repolarization, the epicardial events were mirrored well on the anterior chest surface. However, when the recording points were at a distance greater than that over which the epicardial potential gradients existed, the details of the epicardial events disappeared and their effect was to produce distinct changes in the low-level potentials over broad distant areas. The major manifestations on the body surface of selective epicardial events frequently were changes in the distant low-level potential areas while there was no change in the pattern near the maximum or minimum. The ST-T wave body surface distributions were as useful as the QRS patterns for localizing the ventricular ectopic foci presented. A direct experimental basis is provided for explaining T wave notches which occurred during normal and ectopic beats and resembled U waves. It should be possible to achieve as precise an understanding of ST-T waves on the basis of epicardial potential distributions as has thus far been achieved for QRS on the basis of isochrones.},

abstract = {To achieve a deeper understanding of the brain, scientists, and clinicians use electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) inverse methods to reconstruct sources in the cortical sheet of the human brain. The influence of structural and electrical anisotropy in both the skull and the white matter on the EEG and MEG source reconstruction is not well understood. In this paper, we report on a study of the sensitivity to tissue anisotropy of the EEG/MEG forward problem for deep and superficial neocortical sources with differing orientation components in an anatomically accurate model of the human head. The goal of the study was to gain insight into the effect of anisotropy of skull and white matter conductivity through the visualization of field distributions, isopotential surfaces, and return current flow and through statistical error measures. One implicit premise of the study is that factors that affect the accuracy of the forward solution will have at least as strong an influence over solutions to the associated inverse problem. Major findings of the study include (1) anisotropic white matter conductivity causes return currents to flow in directions parallel to the white matter fiber tracts; (2) skull anisotropy has a smearing effect on the forward potential computation; and (3) the deeper a source lies and the more it is surrounded by anisotropic tissue, the larger the influence of this anisotropy on the resulting electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, for the EEG, the presence of tissue anisotropy both for the skull and white matter compartment substantially compromises the forward potential computation and as a consequence, the inverse source reconstruction. In contrast, for the MEG, only the anisotropy of the white matter compartment has a significant effect. Finally, return currents with high amplitudes were found in the highly conducting cerebrospinal fluid compartment, underscoring the need for accurate modeling of this space. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In cardiac hypertrophy, both excessive enlargement of cardiac myocytes (CMs) and progressive fibrosis are known to occur simultaneously. To investigate the nature of interactions between ventricular CMs and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in these conditions, we have established a "dedifferentiated model" of adult murine CMs in coculture with CFs. In such a model, which is recognized to study cardiac cell hypertrophy in vitro, dedifferentiated CMs in culture and in coculture were characterized by immunopositive staining to ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) and beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC). The results confirm that ANP secretion by CMs was significantly increased during the cultures. The increase size of cultured CMs was significantly higher in CM/CF cocultures than in CM cultures which was also observed when CMs were cultured with fibroblast conditioned medium (FCM). In addition, fibroblast proliferation studies showed that CMs favored fibroblast adhesion and/or growth at the beginning of the coculture and fibroblast proliferation throughout the time course of the coculture. Furthermore, a significant level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production was detected by ELISA in CM/CF cocultures. A similar higher increase was observed when CMs were cultured in the presence of FCM. These results demonstrate that CFs enhance myocyte hypertrophy and that CMs regulate fibroblast adhesion and/or proliferation, suggesting a paracrine interaction between CMs and CFs which could involve IL-6.},

abstract = {In mammals, enlargement of the heart during embryonic development is primarily dependent on the increase in cardiomyocyte numbers. Shortly after birth, however, cardiomyocytes stop proliferating and further growth of the myocardium occurs through hypertrophic enlargement of the existing myocytes. As a consequence of the minimal renewal of cardiomyocytes during adult life, repair of cardiac damage through myocardial regeneration is very limited. Here we show that the exogenous administration of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) markedly stimulates cardiomyocyte proliferation and promotes cardiac repair. We performed a high-content microscopy, high-throughput functional screening for human miRNAs that promoted neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation using a whole-genome miRNA library. Forty miRNAs strongly increased both DNA synthesis and cytokinesis in neonatal mouse and rat cardiomyocytes. Two of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-590 and hsa-miR-199a) were further selected for testing and were shown to promote cell cycle re-entry of adult cardiomyocytes ex vivo and to promote cardiomyocyte proliferation in both neonatal and adult animals. After myocardial infarction in mice, these miRNAs stimulated marked cardiac regeneration and almost complete recovery of cardiac functional parameters. The miRNAs identified hold great promise for the treatment of cardiac pathologies consequent to cardiomyocyte loss.},

Manual segmentation of cardiac cine MR images for acquiring these parameters is time-consuming. Accuracy and automation are the two important criteria in improving cardiac image segmentation methods. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to segment the left ventricle from short axis cine cardiac MR images automatically. Our method incorporates a number of image processing and analysis techniques including thresholding, edge detection, mathematical morphology, and image filtering to build an efficient process flow. This process flow makes use of various features in cardiac MR images to achieve high accurate segmentation results. Our method was tested on 45 clinical short axis cine cardiac images and the results are compared with manual delineated ground truth (average perpendicular distance of contours near 2 mm and mean myocardium mass overlapping over 90{\%}). This approach provides cardiac radiologists a practical method for an accurate segmentation of the left ventricle.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the role of Purkinje fibers in monomorphic, post-infarction ventricular tachycardia (VT).

BACKGROUND: Ventricular fibrillation and polymorphic VT in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI) may be triggered by ectopy arising from Purkinje fibers.

METHODS: From among a group of 81 consecutive patients with post-infarction monomorphic VT referred for catheter ablation, 9 patients were identified in whom the clinical VT had a QRS duration {\textless} or =145 ms. Mapping was performed focusing on areas with Purkinje potentials.

RESULTS: A total of 11 VTs with a QRS duration {\textless} or =145 ms were induced and mapped in the 9 patients; 9 of the 11 VTs had a right bundle branch block/left-axis morphology that mimicked left posterior fascicular VT. The mean VT cycle length was 402 +/- 82 ms. Eight of 9 patients had a history of inferior MI involving the left ventricular septum. One patient had an anterior wall MI with septal involvement. Mapping during VT demonstrated re-entry involving the inferior left ventricular wall. In each of the VTs, a Purkinje potential was present at the exit site of the VT re-entry circuit. Single radiofrequency catheter ablation lesions were successful in eliminating these VTs in all patients.

CONCLUSIONS: The Purkinje system may be part of the re-entry circuit in patients with post-infarction monomorphic VT, resulting in a type of VT with a relatively narrow QRS complex that mimics fascicular VT.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study sought to determine the utility of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in predicting cardiac events in the year after testing. BACKGROUND: Increasingly, DSE has been applied to risk stratification of patients. METHODS: Medical records of 1,183 consecutive patients who underwent DSE were reviewed. The cardiac events that occurred during the 12 months after DSE were tabulated: myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Patient exclusions included organ transplant receipt or evaluation, recent PTCA, noncardiac death, and lack of follow-up. A positive stress echocardiogram (SE) was defined as new or worsened wall-motion abnormalities (WMAs) consistent with ischemia during DSE. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis identified variables that best predicted future cardiac events. RESULTS: The average age was 68 ± 12 years, with 338 women and 220 men. The overall cardiac event rate was 34{\%} if SE was positive, and 10{\%} if it was negative. The event rates for MI and death were 10{\%} and 8{\%}, respectively, if SE was positive, and 3{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively, if SE was negative. If an ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) and a positive SE were present, the overall event rate was 42{\%}, versus a 7{\%} rate when ECG and SE were negative for ischemia. Rest WMA was the most useful variable in predicting future cardiac events using CART: 25{\%} of patients with and 696 without a rest WMA had an event. Other important variables were a dobutamine EF {\textless}52.5{\%}, a positive SE, an ischemic ECG response, history of hypertension and age. CONCLUSIONS: A positive SE provides useful prognostic information that is enhanced by also considering rest-wall motion, stress ECG response, and dobutamine EF.},

abstract = {Aptamer-based sensors provide a versatile and effective platform for the detection of chemical and biological targets. These sensors have been optimized to function in multiple formats, however, a remaining limitation is the inability to achieve temporal control over their sensing function. To overcome this challenge, we took inspiration from nature's ability to temporally control the activity of enzymes and protein receptors through covalent self-caging. We applied this strategy to structure-switching aptamer sensors through the installation of a cleavable linker between the two DNA fragments that comprise the sensor. Analogous to self-caged proteins, installation of this linker shifts the equilibrium of the aptamer sensor to disfavor target binding. However, activity can be restored in a time-resolved manner by cleavage of the linker. To demonstrate this principle, we chose a photocleavable linker and found that installation of the linker eliminates target binding, even at high target concentrations. However, upon irradiation with 365 nm light, sensor activity is restored with response kinetics that mirror those of the linker cleavage reaction. A key benefit of our approach is generality, which is demonstrated by grafting the photocleavable linker onto a different aptamer sensor and showing that an analogous level of temporal control can be achieved for sensing of the new target molecule. These results demonstrate that nature's self-caging approach can be effectively applied to non-natural receptors to provide precise temporal control over function. We envision that this will be of especially high utility for deploying aptamer sensors in biological environments.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, the field of microribonucleic acid (miRNA) in cardiovascular biology and disease has expanded at an incredible pace. miRNAs are themselves part of a larger family, that of non-coding RNAs, the importance of which for biological processes is starting to emerge. miRNAs are ∼22-nucleotide-long RNA sequences that can legate messenger (m)RNAs at partially complementary binding sites, and hence regulate the rate of protein synthesis by altering the stability of the targeted mRNAs. In the cardiovascular system, miRNAs have been shown to be critical regulators of development and physiology. They control basic functions in virtually all cell types relevant to the cardiovascular system (such as endothelial cells, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, inflammatory cells, and fibroblasts) and, thus, are directly involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases. As a result of their role in disease, they are being studied for exploitation in diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. However, there are still significant obstacles that need to be overcome before they enter the clinical arena. We present here a review of the literature and outline the directions toward their use in the clinic. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {AIMS: Investigation of Gq signalling with pharmacological agonists of Gq-coupled receptors lacks spatio-temporal precision. The aim of this study was to establish melanopsin, a light-sensitive Gq-coupled receptor, as a new tool for the investigation of spatial and temporal effects of Gq stimulation on pacemaking in cardiomyocytes at an early developmental stage. METHODS AND RESULTS: A vector for ubiquitous expression of melanopsin was tested in HEK293FT cells, which showed light-induced production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate and elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Mouse embryonic stem cells were stably transfected with this plasmid and differentiated into spontaneously beating embryoid bodies (EBs). Cardiomyocytes within EBs showed melanopsin expression and illumination (60 s, 308.5 nW/mm(2), 470 nm) of EBs increased beating rate within 10.2 +/- 1.7 s to 317.1 +/- 16.3{\%} of baseline frequency. Illumination as short as 5 s was sufficient for generating the maximal frequency response. After termination of illumination, baseline frequency was reached with a decay constant of 27.1 +/- 2.5 s. The light-induced acceleration of beating frequency showed a sigmoid dependence on light intensity with a half maximal effective light intensity of 41.7 nW/mm(2). Interestingly, EBs showed a high rate of irregular contractions after termination of high-intensity illumination. Local Gq activation by illumination of a small region in a functional syncytium of cardiomyocytes led to pacemaker activity within the illuminated area. CONCLUSIONS: Light-induced Gq activation in melanopsin-expressing cardiomyocytes increases beating rate and generates local pacemaker activity. We propose that melanopsin is a powerful optogenetic tool for the investigation of spatial and temporal aspects of Gq signalling in cardiovascular research.},

abstract = {The underlying pathophysiology of ischemia is poorly understood, resulting in unreliable clinical diagnosis of this disease. This limited knowledge of underlying mechanisms suggested a data driven approach, which seeks to identify patterns in the ECG data that can be linked statistically to underlying behavior and conditions of ischemic tissue. Previous studies have suggested that an approach known as Laplacian eigenmaps (LE) can identify trajectories, or manifolds, that are sensitive to different spatiotemporal consequences of ischemic stress, and thus serve as potential clinically relevant biomarkers. We applied the LE approach to measured transmural potentials in several canine preparations, recorded during control and ischemic conditions, and discovered regions on an approximated QRS-derived manifold that were sensitive to ischemia. By identifying a vector pointing to ischemia-associated changes to the manifold and measuring the shift in trajectories along that vector during ischemia, which we denote as Mshift, it was possible to also pull that vector back into signal space and determine which electrodes were responsible for driving the observed changes in the manifold. We refer to the signal space change as the manifold differential (Mdiff). Both the Mdiff and Mshift metrics show a similar degree of sensitivity to ischemic changes as standard metrics applied during the ST segment in detecting ischemic regions. The new metrics also were able to distinguish between sub-types of ischemia. Thus our results indicate that it may be possible to use the Mshift and Mdiff metrics along with ST derived metrics to determine whether tissue within the myocardium is ischemic or not.},

Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method.

abstract = {Unlike adult mammals, adult zebrafish vigorously regenerate lost heart muscle in response to injury. The epicardium, a mesothelial cell layer enveloping the myocardium, is activated to proliferate after cardiac injury and can contribute vascular support cells or provide mitogens to regenerating muscle. Here, we applied proteomics to identify secreted proteins that are associated with heart regeneration. We found that Fibronectin, a main component of the extracellular matrix, is induced and deposited after cardiac damage. In situ hybridization and transgenic reporter analyses indicated that expression of two fibronectin paralogues, fn1 and fn1b, are induced by injury in epicardial cells, while the itgb3 receptor is induced in cardiomyocytes near the injury site. fn1, the more dynamic of these paralogs, is induced chamber-wide within one day of injury before localizing epicardial Fn1 synthesis to the injury site. fn1 loss-of-function mutations disrupted zebrafish heart regeneration, as did induced expression of a dominant-negative Fibronectin cassette, defects that were not attributable to direct inhibition of cardiomyocyte proliferation. These findings reveal a new role for the epicardium in establishing an extracellular environment that supports heart regeneration.},

abstract = {Objectives: We measured the uptake of technetium-99m tetrofosmin ((99m)Tc) and thallium-201 (201Tl) in areas of healed transmural myocardial infarction and in regions of acute peri-infarction ischemia. Methods: Anesthetised pigs with a 1-month old transmural infarction elicited by permanent ligature of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery below the first branch underwent one hour of proximal LAD occlusion followed by injection of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and201Tl either in the left atrium (GI, n = 19) or in the jugular vein (GII, n = 6). Twelve other pigs (GIII) with a similar acute peri-infarction ischemia received (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and201Tl into the left ventricle during cardiocirculatory arrest to rule out the effect of coronary collaterals. Radiotracer counting was determined in samples from normal, acute ischemic and necrotic regions. Results: Uptake of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and201Tl was greater in the infarct scar (median {\%} of normal tissue: 20 for (99m)Tc and 8.6 for201Tl in GI; 22 and 15 in GII) than in acute ischemic myocardium (3.2 and 2.5 in GI; 6.4 and 3.3 in GII). Radiotracer injection in arrested hearts (GIII) depicted a similar pattern (median {\%} of injected dose; 6.2 for (99m)Tc and 10 for201Tl in the scar; 2,3 and 4,0 in acute ischemia; and 2.9 and 3.5 in normal tissue). The infarcted region showed connective tissue and lack of viable myocardium. Conclusions: A 1-month old infarct scar with no viable myocardial tissue can take up significant fractions of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin and201Tl even in the absence of coronary collateral perfusion. Data suggest that the infarct scar can extract these radiotracers from the intraventricular blood.},

abstract = {The distribution of atherosclerotic lesions within the rabbit vasculature, particularly within the descending thoracic aorta, has been mapped in numerous studies. The patchy nature of such lesions has been attributed to local variation in the pattern of blood flow. However, there have been few attempts to model and characterize the flow. In this study, a high-order continuous Galerkin finite-element method was used to simulate blood flow within a realistic representation of the rabbit aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The geometry, which was obtained from computed tomography of a resin corrosion cast, included all vessels originating from the aortic arch (followed to at least their second generation) and five pairs of intercostal arteries originating from the proximal descending thoracic aorta. The simulations showed that small geometrical undulations associated with the ductus arteriosus scar cause significant deviations in wall shear stress (WSS). This finding highlights the importance of geometrical accuracy when analysing WSS or related metrics. It was also observed that two Dean-type vortices form in the aortic arch and propagate down the descending thoracic aorta (along with an associated skewed axial velocity profile). This leads to the occurrence of axial streaks in WSS, similar in nature to the axial streaks of lipid deposition found in the descending aorta of cholesterol-fed rabbits. Finally, it was observed that WSS patterns within the vicinity of intercostal branch ostia depend not only on local flow features caused by the branches themselves, but also on larger-scale flow features within the descending aorta, which vary between branches at different locations. This result implies that disease and WSS patterns in the vicinity of intercostal ostia are best compared on a branch-by-branch basis.},

abstract = {Background: Earliest recorded postshock myocardial activations in pigs originate in the subepicardium of the apex and lateral free wall of the left ventricle (LV) 30-90 ms after the shock. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Purkinje system is a candidate for the source of postshock activations by performing endocardial and transmural postshock activation mapping. Methods: In five pigs, 32 plunge needles with 12 electrodes (1-mm spacing) were inserted into the LV apex and lateral free wall. Up to 70 plunge needles with six electrodes (2-mm spacing) were spread throughout the remainder of the LV, while 9-12 plunge needles with four electrodes (2-mm spacing) were inserted into the right ventricle. A basket catheter with 32 bipolar recording sites was inserted into the LV. Defibrillation-threshold (DFT)-level shocks were delivered during 10 episodes of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation. Electrograms of postshock activation cycles were analyzed for Purkinje and myocardial activations. Results: Purkinje activations were recorded before local myocardial activation in 9{\%} of basket electrograms and in 15{\%} of plunge needles during the first postshock activation cycle. Purkinje activations were identified during the first and subsequent several postshock activation cycles in at least one basket and one needle electrogram in 96{\%} and 98{\%} of defibrillation episodes, respectively. Conclusions: The Purkinje system is active during the early postshock activation cycles after DFT-level shocks. Further studies are required to determine whether activation initiates in the Purkinje system or whether it is activated by the myocardium or by Purkinje-myocardial junctional cells. {\textcopyright} 2007 Heart Rhythm Society.},

Whether the capacity for cardiac regeneration is absent in mammals or whether it exists and is switched off early after birth has been unclear. We found that the hearts of 1-day-old neonatal mice can regenerate after partial surgical resection, but this capacity is lost by 7 days of age. This regenerative response in 1-day-old mice was characterized by cardiomyocyte proliferation with minimal hypertrophy or fibrosis, thereby distinguishing it from repair processes. Genetic fate mapping indicated that the majority of cardiomyocytes within the regenerated tissue originated from preexisting cardiomyocytes. Echocardiography performed 2 months after surgery revealed that the regenerated ventricular apex had normal systolic function. Thus, for a brief period after birth, the mammalian heart appears to have the capacity to regenerate.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Left atrial fibrosis is prominent in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Extensive atrial tissue fibrosis identified by delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with poor outcomes of AF catheter ablation.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the feasibility of atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI and its association with subsequent AF ablation outcome.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and persistent AF (undergoing their first catheter ablation) conducted between August 2010 and August 2011 at 15 centers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Delayed enhancement MRI images were obtained up to 30 days before ablation.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Fibrosis quantification was performed at a core laboratory blinded to the participating center, ablation approach, and procedure outcome. Fibrosis blinded to the treating physicians was categorized as stage 1 ({\textless}10{\%} of the atrial wall), 2 (≥10{\%}-{\textless}20{\%}), 3 (≥20{\%}-{\textless}30{\%}), and 4 (≥30{\%}). Patients were followed up for recurrent arrhythmia per current guidelines using electrocardiography or ambulatory monitor recording and results were analyzed at a core laboratory. Cumulative incidence of recurrence was estimated by stage at days 325 and 475 after a 90-day blanking period (standard time allowed for arrhythmias related to ablation-induced inflammation to subside) and the risk of recurrence was estimated (adjusting for 10 demographic and clinical covariates).

RESULTS: Atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI was successfully quantified in 272 of 329 enrolled patients (57 patients [17{\%}] were excluded due to poor MRI quality). There were 260 patients who were followed up after the blanking period (mean [SD] age of 59.1 [10.7] years, 31.5{\%} female, 64.6{\%} with paroxysmal AF). For recurrent arrhythmia, the unadjusted overall hazard ratio per 1{\%} increase in left atrial fibrosis was 1.06 (95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.08; P {\textless} .001). Estimated unadjusted cumulative incidence of recurrent arrhythmia by day 325 for stage 1 fibrosis was 15.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 7.6{\%}-29.6{\%}); stage 2, 32.6{\%} (95{\%} CI, 24.3{\%}-42.9{\%}); stage 3, 45.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 35.5{\%}-57.5{\%}); and stage 4, 51.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 32.8{\%}-72.2{\%}) and by day 475 was 15.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 7.6{\%}-29.6{\%}), 35.8{\%} (95{\%} CI, 26.2{\%}-47.6{\%}), 45.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 35.6{\%}-57.5{\%}), and 69.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 48.6{\%}-87.7{\%}), respectively. Similar results were obtained after covariate adjustment. The addition of fibrosis to a recurrence prediction model that includes traditional clinical covariates resulted in an improved predictive accuracy with the C statistic increasing from 0.65 to 0.69 (risk difference of 0.05; 95{\%} CI, 0.01-0.09).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation, atrial tissue fibrosis estimated by delayed enhancement MRI was independently associated with likelihood of recurrent arrhythmia. The clinical implications of this association warrant further investigation.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate different electrical markers for their potential to detect the earliest phases of acute myocardial ischemia. METHODS We conducted acute ischemia studies in open chest animal, by creating finely controlled demand or supply ischemic episodes and recording intramyocardial and epicardial potentials. RESULTS Under the conditions of mild perfusion deficit, acute ischemia induced changes in the T wave that were larger and could be detected earlier on the epicardial surface than ST-segment changes. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that in the setting of very acute ischemia, epicardial T waves have higher sensitivity to mild degrees of acute ischemia than epicardial ST potentials. These results suggest that changes in the T wave shape may augment shifts in ST segments to improve ECG based localization of ischemia.},

abstract = {Electrical uncoupling at gap junctions during acute myocardial ischemia contributes to conduction abnormalities and reentrant arrhythmias. Increased levels of intracellular Ca(2+) and H(+) and accumulation of amphipathic lipid metabolites during ischemia promote uncoupling, but other mechanisms may play a role. We tested the hypothesis that uncoupling induced by acute ischemia is associated with changes in phosphorylation of the major cardiac gap junction protein, connexin43 (Cx43). Adult rat hearts perfused on a Langendorff apparatus were subjected to ischemia or ischemia/reperfusion. Changes in coupling were monitored by measuring whole-tissue resistance. Changes in the amount and distribution of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated isoforms of Cx43 were measured by immunoblotting and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using isoform-specific antibodies. In control hearts, virtually all Cx43 identified immunohistochemically at apparent intercellular junctions was phosphorylated. During ischemia, however, Cx43 underwent progressive dephosphorylation with a time course similar to that of electrical uncoupling. The total amount of Cx43 did not change, but progressive reduction in total Cx43 immunofluorescent signal and concomitant accumulation of nonphosphorylated Cx43 signal occurred at sites of intercellular junctions. Functional recovery during reperfusion was associated with increased levels of phosphorylated Cx43. These observations suggest that uncoupling induced by ischemia is associated with dephosphorylation of Cx43, accumulation of nonphosphorylated Cx43 within gap junctions, and translocation of Cx43 from gap junctions into intracellular pools.},

Our objective was to develop a technique for ligation of nonvisible coronary artery branches to permit the reliable creation of infarcts of uniformly small size and location. From latex castings of the left coronary artery of C57BL/6J mice (n = 53), we calculated the highest probability for the location of branch points of two of three left ventricular (LV) branches distal to the origin of the left main descending artery. On the basis of these anatomic probabilities, we blindly ligated two areas that were likely to be locations of these nonvisible LV branches. We were successful in producing two types of small transmural myocardial infarctions (16.04 +/- 3.64 and 4.68 +/- 1.47{\%} of the LV) in 57{\%} of attempts. Thus our branch pattern probability-assisted method permits routine creation of small infarcts of uniform size in the mouse.},

abstract = {Despite the widespread use of electrocardiogram (ECG), changes in cardiac activity resulting from ischemia or altered recovery characteristics sometimes remain electrocardiographically 'silent' or are first detectable by techniques that measure ventricular contractility, such as ultrasound or blood pressure. Especially local changes in repolarization can go undetected when ECG electrodes do not lie close to the area of the heart affected. Experiments were performed on an isolated, perfused canine heart suspended in a realistically shaped, instrumented, electrolytic torso tank with the goal of determining some mechanisms for these ambiguities. By recording simultaneously both epicardial and torso tank surface potentials, complete descriptions were obtained of the electrical response to interventions such as coronary occlusions and alterations in pacing site and frequency. One hypothesis was that some interventions produce highly variable ECG responses primarily because of differences in their location within the heart. To test this, the effect was measured of repeating the same intervention as the heart's location and orientation in the tank were varied. A numerical forward solution was also used to investigate variation of torso tank potentials with heart location. The resulting changes in tank surface potentials illustrate how, for example, precordial ST-segment shifts following occlusion change from elevation to depression to become almost undetectable as the heart rotates in the tank. The results suggest that some events are electrocardiographically silent because of the complex geometric relationship of the heart, torso, and site of the lesion, as well as the spatial sampling and analysis techniques used in detection.},

abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to assess acute ablation injuries seen on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) immediately post-ablation (IPA) and the association with permanent scar 3 months post-ablation (3moPA). Background Success rates for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation vary significantly, in part because of limited information about the location, extent, and permanence of ablation injury at the time of procedure. Although the amount of scar on LGE MRI months after ablation correlates with procedure outcomes, early imaging predictors of scar remain elusive. Methods Thirty-seven patients presenting for atrial fibrillation ablation underwent high-resolution MRI with a 3-dimensional LGE sequence before ablation, IPA, and 3moPA using a 3-T scanner. The acute left atrial wall injuries on IPA scans were categorized as hyperenhancing (HE) or nonenhancing (NE) and compared with scar 3moPA. Results Heterogeneous injuries with HE and NE regions were identified in all patients. Dark NE regions in the left atrial wall on LGE MRI demonstrate findings similar to the “no-reflow” phenomenon. Although the left atrial wall showed similar amounts of HE, NE, and normal tissue IPA (37.7 ± 13{\%}, 34.3 ± 14{\%}, and 28.0 ± 11{\%}, respectively; p = NS), registration of IPA injuries with 3moPA scarring demonstrated that 59.0 ± 19{\%} of scar resulted from NE tissue, 30.6 ± 15{\%} from HE tissue, and 10.4 ± 5{\%} from tissue identified as normal. Paired t-test comparisons were all statistically significant among NE, HE, and normal tissue types (p {\textless} 0.001). Arrhythmia recurrence at 1-year follow-up correlated with the degree of wall enhancement 3moPA (p = 0.02). Conclusions Radiofrequency ablation results in heterogeneous injury on LGE MRI with both HE and NE wall lesions. The NE lesions demonstrate no-reflow characteristics and reveal a better predictor of final scar at 3 months. Scar correlates with procedure outcomes, further highlighting the importance of early scar prediction.},

@article{Mulchrone2014,
abstract = {— This study presents early data in the development of a novel mouse model of heart failure utilizing thermal ablation on cardiac valves to induce valvular regurgitation. Thermal ablation of the valve was achieved through the application of radiofrequency (RF) electrical current. The objective was to apply enough energy to induce valve stiffening and retraction, which was hypothesized to produce valve insufficiency and blood regurgitation in vivo. Preliminary studies were performed to develop a workable energy delivery catheter that could be inserted through the carotid artery to the aortic valve. Catheter position between the aortic valve leaflets was verified by echocardiography. Valve function was evaluated before and after the thermal insult using Doppler measurements near the valve inflow and outflow, and early results demonstrate that the energy delivery catheter could successfully induce acute valve insufficiency. Further study is needed to refine the catheter to provide greater control over the degree of thermal damage and resulting changes in cardiac physiology},
