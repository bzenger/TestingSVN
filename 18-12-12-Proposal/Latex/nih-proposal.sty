% File: nih-proposal.sty
%
% A file with some style features for writing a proposal in NIH format
% \Latex{}.
% Note: this works best for the paper version of the proposal.  See 
% elsewhere for templates for electronic versions
%
% Things included in the file are:
%
% Headings: the NIH has these nifty forms they like for grants and this
%          style files makes 'em for you.
% Bibliography: the standard hading for the bibliography is changed here to
%          read ``cited references'' and be marked with a section number
%          (section 9 in a standard grant application.)
% Caption spacing: there is a problem in \Latex{} when centering figures
%          above the caption and Nelson Beebe seems to have figured out
%          a work around.  It involves redefining the \caption command
%          to remove the 10pt of slace that is always added between the
%          caption and the box that the figure environment puts things in.
%
% To use this, set your document style to something like this:
%
% \documentstyle[11pt]{article}
% \usepackage{nih-proposal}
% \usepackage{graphicx}
% \usepackage{wrapfig}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FIGURE
% Standard for Report is to include chapter number in the figure
% but we don't want chapter number to appear anywhere and replace
% the figure naming convention with something more suitable
\renewcommand \thefigure
     {\ifnum \c@section>\z@ \thesection.\fi \@arabic\c@figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Line spacing
% Use this command for ``double'' spacing
%\setlength{\baselineskip}{1.2\baselineskip}
% and this one for an acceptable NIH spacing of 6lpi based on 11pt
%\setlength{\baselineskip}{.9\baselineskip}
% The baselineskip does not appear to work when we include a maketitle
% command in the main file.  Something there must set the line spacing
% If we use this next command, then things seem to work.
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{.9}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Paragraph spacing
% This sets the spacing between paragraphs
\setlength{\parskip}{\smallskipamount} 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Define how section numbers are formatted
\renewcommand{\thechapter}{}
\renewcommand{\thesection}{\arabic{section}}
\renewcommand{\thesubsection}{\arabic{section}.\arabic{subsection}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Figspace command
% This one makes space for a figure but marks it as missing

\newcommand{\figspace}[1]{\fbox{\parbox[c][3in]{\columnwidth}
  {\centerline{Space for #1}}}}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Redefine the standard chapter formatting
\def\@makechapterhead#1{ \vspace*{50pt} { \parindent 0pt \raggedright

 \huge\bf \thechapter \hskip 1ex \fi #1\par

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% New lists
% Make up some new lists for doing enumerate and itemize which close down
% the spacings between items in the list.

% Note: adjust the values of \itemsep and \parsep to determine spacing.
% Negative numbers are permitted and usually it looks best to have both
% values equal
