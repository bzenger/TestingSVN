\section{Specific Aims}

The \textit{most} common reason for a patient to visit the emergency
department is chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia. Myocardial ischemia
develops from inadequate perfusion of myocardial tissue and indicates the
presence of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, or other
potentially fatal cardiac diseases. Current noninvasive tests to detect
ischemia may be limited by inco

The long-term goal of this project is to develop and use experimental
models and computer simulations to devise better techt to have extensive and high-resolution coverage on all three relevant regions of the heart. Our preliminary data suggests these experimental models can
      be used to uncover novel relationships between tissue-level
      electrical responses to ischemia and the corresponding ECG
      body-surface recording manifestations.
	
    \item [Aim 2:] \textbf{Test the hypothesis that exercise and dobutamine
        infusion create identical regions of myocardial ischemia.} Cardiac
      stress is induced via exercise or pharmacological agents, but no
      study has investigated the ischemic regions produced during each
      method of stress as identified with high-resolution electrical recordings. We will test and determine if the ischemia detected
      from electrical signals is different when using different cardiac
      stress mechanisms using a novel high-resolution electrical recordings
      that have never before been available. Understanding these
      differences will further improve the diagnostic performance to detect
      ischemia under different forms of cardiac stress.
	
    \item [Aim 3:] \textbf{Test the hypothesis that ECG imaging techniques
        can be used to detect and localize ischemic regions within the heart.} Current ECG methods are unable to delineate locations of
      myocardial ischemia within the heart. We will formulate novel
      ECGI-based approaches and verify that these formulations can
      accurately and reproducibly detect and localize ischemic sources with
      higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional ECG
      methods. Using these ECGI techniques, we will identify the ischemic
      sources within the myocardial wall from body-surface recordings and
      verify the ischemic sources detected using experimental models.
	
	%\item [\bf Aim 3:] \textbf{Test the hypothesis that a modified ECG system and ECGI techniques can be used to determine locations of myocardial ischemia.} Full body surface mapping is not feasible in the clinical setting because of the time and resources required to appropriately prepare, acquire, and analyze the electrical signals. We propose using validated ECGI techniques to guide us toward efficient ways of sensing key features in the ECG that will detect and localize myocaridial ischemia. To do this, we will identify a series of smaller lead sets and apply our ECGI techniques to detect certain ischemic regions within the heart. These simplified lead sets will be applied sequentially to isolate the region of myocardial ischemia. Success in this aim will translate our scientific findings to meaningful clinical application in real world scenarios.
	
	%\item [\bf Aim 3: ] \textbf{Test the hypothesis that electrical signals on the body surface change significantly and reproducibly in an acute myocardial ischemia model subjected to pharmacological stressors compared to pacing.} Current experimental models have struggled to characterize possible changes to the electrical signals as they pass through tissue surrounding the heart to the body surface. Using our model we will be able to visualize electrophysiological changes on the heart and body surface simultaneously. These data would provide body surface electrical changes that could guide noninvase detection metrics to determine the ischemic region within the heart.

Success in this project will lead to improvements
in detection and clinical diagnosis of myocardial ischemia using ECGI
techniques validated with experimental data. Our experimental
approach will be valuable for various cardiac modeling applications,
including validation studies for other ECGI techniques. By comparing
exercise and pharmacological stress at the fine scale, our experiments will be the first high-resolution analysis and will increase our understanding of myocardial ischemia development
to guide the
interpretation of clinical stress tests. Finally, as we detect ischemia
early and accurately, we will limit patient burden and increase therapeutic
success.  Conducting these studies in this rich
mentoring environment will ensure deep exposure to all aspects of research
and facilitate my development as an independent physician scientist.

%Despite the increased understanding of electrical indicators within myocardial ischemia, where myocardial tissue supply of nutrients is less than the amount needed for normal heart function, little is understood about how to clinically identify these parameters. Current tests used to detect these electrical changes are induced via exercise stressing the heart and recording electrical changes. Yet the most sensitive tests for myocardial ischemia, pharmacological stress testing with combined ultrasound imaging, have shown little to no change in common ischemia defining electrical indicators. With the confirmed identification of ischemia, but no indication via electrical indicators, healthcare professionals largely disregard potentially key information about heart status and dismiss their possible value as a diagnostic tool. To continue our advancement in understanding of ischemia, and improve diagnostic testing and identification, this disparity of detection between different tests must be addressed. 

%This limited understanding of the electrical signals that indicate myocardial ischemia hinder our ability to adequately diagnose and treat patients suffering 

%Despite recent advances in cardiac treatment, undetected myocardial ischemia remains a high cause of mortality in the United States. Ischemia is a condition where the myocardial tissue's demand for nutrients is larger than the available supply. Myocardial ischemia plays a role in decreasing heart function, development of heart failure, and inducing fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Knowing these consequences, physicians and health care professionals attempt to detect ischemia using several different methods such as exercise stress testing, nuclear imaging, or pharmacological stress testing. Despite the multitude of testing, ischemia While each test is used to detect ischemia, electrical indicators of myocardial ischemia vary greatly depending on the test. Although the clinical community recognizes this variation, little is understood about why it exists. Insights into these differences may provide new information in detecting and diagnosing myocardial ischemia to help mitigate and prevent long term damage. 


%Pharmacological stress tests use drugs, typically dobutamine, to induce cardiac stress by increasing heart rate and cardiac muscle contraction force. Myocardial ischemia is detected during these pharmacological stress tests by ultrasound imaging or echocardiography alone neglecting a key cardiac function indicator, heart electrical cardiac signals. Most analysis of myocardial electrical signals have been dismissed for perceived decreased sensitivity compared to imaging. However, detection of myocardial ischemia via pharmacological stress testing sensitivity and specificity decent at best with many cases of ischemia not detected. In addition, echocardiography is a complicated task requiring several experts and increased resources to detect ischemic indicators.

%To bridge this gap in understanding indicators of myocardial ischemia we propose a study to investigate the electrical signals of the heart during routine pharmacological cardiac stress testing compared to routine exercise stress testing. Our underlying hypothesis is that measured heart electrical signals change significantly and reproducibly under pharmacological stress testing during myocardial ischemia much like during exercise induced ischemia. To test this hypothesis we will develop an acute myocardial ischemia animal model with high density electrical recording equipment on the surface of the heart and within the myocardium to detect subtle changes in the electrical signals during myocardial ischemia. Next, we will analyze these signals and determine indicators for ischemia as detected by the electrogram recordings. Finally, we will measure body surface electrical signals and identify indicators of ischemia, during a pharmacological stress test, on the body surface.
