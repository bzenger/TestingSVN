\section{Specific Aims}

The \textit{most} common reason for a patient to visit the emergency
department is chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia. Myocardial ischemia
develops from inadequate perfusion of myocardial tissue and indicates the
presence of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, or other
potentially fatal cardiac diseases. Current noninvasive tests to detect
ischemia may be limited by incoischemia under different forms of cardiac stress.

Success in this project will lead to improvements
in detection and clinical diagnosis of myocardial ischemia using ECGI
techniques validated with experimental data. Our experimental
approach will be valuable for various cardiac modeling applications,
including validation studies for other ECGI techniques. By comparing
exercise and pharmacological stress at the fine scale, our experiments will be the first high-resolution analysis and will increase our understanding of myocardial ischemia development
to guide the
